  From "vegan cupcakes take over the world" these yummy little treats are
  delish! they don't use any eggs or dairy, but skeptics bewarned, these
  cupcakes aren't lacking in anything. i've used half and half whole wheat pasty
  flour and regular flour to great success. and in case you're wondering, one
  big can (20 oz) of crushed pineapple will yield enough for both the cupcakes
  and the topping.
