 - In a food processor , add cauliflower
 - Blend until desired rice consistency
 - Add first 9 ingredients until well combined
 - Set aside
 - In a blender combine sesame oil , tamari , sugar , lime juice
 - Blend until well combined
 - Set aside
 - On a flat surface , place one nori roll and fill entire surface with indian wild rice
 - Repeat process for more nori sheets
 - At the edge closest to you , place a small line of carrot , then small line of radish , small line of alfalfa , small line of spinach , and small line of beetroot
 - Roll the nori sheet tightly but gently away from you
 - With your finger , moistened the edge so that it seals properly
 - With a sharp knife , cut sushi into desired size
 - Drizzle with sauce and enjoy !
 - I did three batches of these
 - One small , one medium and one larger
 - I personally enjoyed the smaller tighter rolled ones
 - Hint and
 - Do not over stuff or the nori sheet will break
 - Best to use the less is more principle
 - Always work with a clean surface in between rolling each nori sheet
 - Keep your hands clean and dry between each ingredient used
 - Clean knife in between each cut
 - Your ingredients choices are only limited by your imagination !
