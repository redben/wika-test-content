description: "I went to orlando florida a couple of years ago and every restaurant i went to had no clue what a caesar was. i was surprised to find out that it was a canadian cocktail.\r\neven the bartender at the motel we stayed at had never heard of it. so, i went to a grocery store and bought the ingredients for it to show the bartendar how to make it. i paid over $8 american for a small bottle of clamato juice!!!"
