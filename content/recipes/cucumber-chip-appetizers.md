description: "Fresh and great when using pre-chilled produce, this smart little appetizer is wonderful as a snack or warm up to your back yard summer dinner party.\r\n\r\ni came up with this recipe when i went on the vegetable broth fast and everyone like it so much i thought i would share the recipe with you.  it is pretty much guacamole on a slice of cucumber.  except while on the fast i omitted the cilantro, onion and seasonings.  still pretty good.\r\n\r\nthe dish is easy and quick to make.  the perfect recipe for unexpected guests or when you find yourself in a pinch for time."

 - Peel and dice all the onion
 - Dice the tomato
 - Chop the cilantro
 - Peel and pit each avocado
 - In a medium sized mixing bowl combine the avocados , onion , tomato , and cilantro smashing it all together with a fork
 - With the lime half squeeze the lime juice into the mixture
 - Add the salt , pepper and chili powder and continue mashing till a creamy / lumpy texture is achieved
 - Set a side
 - With the other lime half rub the cut side on a serving platter so the plate has a thin layer of lime juice on top of it
 - On a cutting board thickly slice a cucumber so each slice is about a quarter of an inch
 - Lay each slice flat on the platter
 - Once all the slices are in place spoon a dollop of the avocado mixture onto each slice of cucumber
 - Garnish with cilantro leaves if you like
 - Enjoy !
