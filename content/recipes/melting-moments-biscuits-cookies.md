  This is from the australian masterchef site but i have omitted the raspberry
  jam as my dh does not like jam in his melting moments and traditionally it was
  never in the originals.  times at this moment are estimated as i have not had
  the time to make as is serving size but think 6 biscuits/cookies would be
  right.  have since made these and got 6 biscuits/cookies (12 halves and joined
  together to make 6).  the dh found these to be very sweet and has suggested it
  may be better to make them smaller (20 gram instead of 40) therefore getting
  12 melting moments but cooking time would need to be adjusted and i think 8 to
  10 minutes would do it - will give a try in a couple of weeks and report back.
