description: >-
  A cornbread for your spicy and or tangy dishes -- nothing sweet about it. most
  cornbread calls for one egg. i think the extra egg gives the bread more body
  and tenderness. this bread bakes in a 10- or 12-inch cast-iron skillet. if you
  don't have one, c'mon, it's time to get real.
