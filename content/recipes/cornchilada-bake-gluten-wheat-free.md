title: Cornchilada Bake Gluten Wheat Free
date: 2012-12-19T00:00:00.000Z
description: "After the plan for enchiladas was foiled due to not having enough corn tortillas, i threw this together. it could easily be spiced up if you like things spicy by adding jalapenos to the cornbread topping.  i used ground turkey the first time, but any ground meat could be used. i used sour cream because my husband doesn't really care for my favorite red enchilada sauce all that much, it helped tame down the \"red\" flavor. \r\n\r\n**after preparing as written, i would have made the following changes:  add a teaspoon or two of sugar to the cornbread mix, add chopped peppers and onions to meat mixture, and personally i'd prefer the straight enchilada sauce and some spice to kick it up. overall it was a tasty and quick throw-together meal i plan to make again.**\r\n\r\nthis recipe was inspired by a recipe called cornburger pie from the cornbread bible: a recipe storybook by jennifer shambrook, phd. i love that book! it's available for kindle, too."
