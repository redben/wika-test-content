description: "This recipe has been posted here for play in zwt9 - scandinavia.  this recipe is from website: missmaud.com.au\r\n\r\nit sounds wonderful to me. \r\n\r\nswedish food tends to be influenced by the seasons with the spicing and cooking; often reflecting the storage needs of the peasant communities of old, as in pickled  herring, freshly salted or smoked meat, or dairy products that have been curdled, boiled or left to mature."
