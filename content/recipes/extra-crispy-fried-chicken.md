 - In a large measuring cup or pitcher , combine cup salt and 2 cups hot tap water
 - Stir until dissolved
 - Add 2 cups cold tap water and stir to combine
 - Add chicken pieces to a large resealable plastic bag
 - Pour brine into bag and seal
 - Transfer to refrigerator , 8-12 hours
 - Fill a large dutch oven or cast iron pot with enough oil to reach a depth of 4 inches
 - Over medium-high , heat oil to 350 degrees on a candy or deep fry thermometer
 - Place a wire rack over a sheet pan and place next to stove
 - In a deep pie plate or cake pan , combine flour , cayenne , paprika , celery seed , 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt , and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon black pepper
 - Whisk to combine
 - Remove a piece of chicken from brine
 - Without shaking off too much liquid , dip directly into flour mixture
 - Using both hands , adhere flour mixture to chicken , using a pinching motion with your fingers to create a rough , shaggy texture with the flour
 - The more you pinch to create this shaggy effect , the more crunchy and textured the fried chicken will be
 - Place on a baking sheet and repeat with remaining pieces
 - Carefully lower 3-4 pieces of chicken into the hot oil
 - Do not overcrowd
 - Fry , flipping occasionally until chicken pieces are deeply golden and read 160 degrees on an instant-read thermometer , about 10-12 minutes
 - Remove with a slotted spoon to the prepared rack , and repeat with remaining pieces , adjusting the flame to maintain 350 degrees
 - Serve
