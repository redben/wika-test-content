 - Drain the tofu , and then remove excess moisture by cutting it in half lengthwise and microwaving on high , uncovered , for two minutes
 - Gently squeeze out and wipe off excess moisture , then throw tofu in the freezer for one or two hours before removing to thaw in the fridge -- this will give the tofu a slightly heavier texture
 - Cut tofu into tiny cubes and arrange in a lidded dish to be marinaded
 - Combine brown sugar , soy sauce and rice vinegar in a small bowl
 - Pour over tofu
 - Let sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour
 - I usually leave it overnight
 - Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat
 - Add tofu , water chestnuts , mushrooms , onion , and garlic and cook until vegetables are tender
 - Dissolve 1 tsp brown sugar in 1 tsp soy sauce and add to pan
 - Saute until well mixed and heated through
 - Spoon mixture into lettuce leaf "bowls"
 - For the sauce , combine sugar , water , soy sauce , rice vinegar , ketchup , lemon juice , sesame oil , mustard and garlic in a bowl
 - Pour over lettuce wraps and serve
