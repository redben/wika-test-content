  A flavored coffee using sugar-free flavored syrups.  i use torani's.  you
  could make this with the regular sugar added syrups if you are not diabetic. 
  for the steamed milk, i use a microwave frother, and pour some of the hot milk
  in the coffee and then froth some to top it with.  also good using cold coffee
  and milk served over ice.
