description: >-
  From the cookbook "a chocolate christmas" this is a bit different from the
  other recipes posted here with the addition of the milk and cinnamon.  makes
  for a great holiday cookie but also a cookie for anytime of the year -
  especially lunch boxes!  sometimes i skip the raisins and just add in chopped
  walnuts or dried cranberries for an even more unique flavor.
