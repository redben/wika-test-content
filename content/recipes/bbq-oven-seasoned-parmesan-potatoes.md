 - Take potatoes , peel , and cut into 2"x2" cubes
 - Mush butter around potatoes until they are totally covered
 - Be careful not to put too much butter though , because they will remain in liquid instead of getting crispy
 - After butter is applied add pepper , salt , garlic powder , and mccormicks montreal steak seasoning to taste
 - If you do not like a garlic taste , just remove the garlic powder
 - Then bake at 425 to 450 degrees for approximately 45 minutes to an hour
 - Take out of the oven and sprinkle freshly grated parmesan cheese on top
 - Allow the cheese to just melt or put back into oven for a few minutes to get the cheese more melted
