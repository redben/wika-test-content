  Ahhhhhh the taste of pizza, but still low carb! this is sb diet friendly for
  phase 1. i searched several low carb websites looking for snack  ideas and
  found a recipe for "pizza" that used melted cheese as its' base. while it
  tasted good, i thought it  was a bit of a pain to melt the cheese to the right
  consistency.  i got to thinking what else i could use instead and came up with
  this.  yummy, fast and simple! you can use any of your favourite pizza
  toppings.
