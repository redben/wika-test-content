 - In a bowl , combine cajun spice , finely ground pepitas and cracked black pepper
 - Coat both sides of the chicken tenders well
 - Set aside
 - You will need to make sure to rub the spice into the chicken
 - Heat pan on medium low
 - Add 4 tablespoons grapeseed oil
 - Add chicken for about 50 second each side
 - Set aside on a paper towel to drain
 - Lower heat to low
 - Add to oil chilli , cumin , cinnamon and any leftover combination mixture of cajun spice , ground pepitas and cracked black pepper
 - Stir for about 3 4 minutes
 - If you have any concerns re your pan smoking , simply remove pan from the stove top
 - Making sure to keep stirring
 - When your confidence returns , simply return it to the stove top until you are happy with the coloring
 - If the spices soak up all of the oil , you may need to add more oil
 - You will want to continuously stir the spices in oil as they do burn easily
 - Do not say you have not been warned ! lol
 - With heat on low , add dark chocolate and stir
 - Combining it with the spices well
 - When the dark chocolate is fully melted , add diced tomatoes
 - Stirring until combined
 - Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes
 - I like chicken bites , so i cut my chicken before returning it to the pan and simmered for an additional 10 minutes
 - Ol !
