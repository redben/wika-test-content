 - Depending on size , halve or quarter your tomatoes
 - Sauce tomatoes are ideal , but any will work
 - I used a combo of roma , beefsteak , and cherry
 - Optional: smoke a tray's worth of the tomatoes
 - I cold smoked mine for a few hours over hickory
 - It gave it a subtle but delicious smoke flavor
 - Again , this is totally optional
 - Add the tomatoes , salt , garlic , sugar , and onions to a pot and boil for 30 minutes
 - Cool the mixture until you can send it safely through your food mill
 - I used the mixer attachment and it worked beautifully
 - If you don't have a food mill , you can peel and squeeze the tomatoes using the boiling water / ice bath method
 - Return the now de-seeded and de-skinned tomato sauce to the pot and back onto the stove
 - Continue to boil the sauce to reduce and thicken
 - Meanwhile , in another non-reactive pot
 - Heat the apple cider vinegar with all the remaining spice additions
 - Heat until the spices have infused into the vinegar
 - Using a fine strainer to leave behind the whole spices , pour the vinegar into the tomato mix
 - If you don't have a strainer or tea-ball , you can wrap the spices in a cheesecloth satchel
 - Continue to reduce until you reach the desired ketchup texture
 - This can take 4-6 hours
 - I've heard of people using a crock pot for this process
 - Follow standard canning procedure if you want a shelf-stable product
 - Otherwise , cool and keep in the fridge
