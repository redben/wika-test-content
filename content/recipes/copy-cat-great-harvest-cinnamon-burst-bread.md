  A copycat recipe for cinnamon burst bread. the light texture of the bread is
  wonderful. cinnamon chips are hard to find, and the ones that i have found so
  far (hershey's)  do not duplicate the taste of the ones in the genuine gh
  bread. i found this recipe on a site that is now defunct so i am posting it
  here to share and for safe keeping.
