  This is another recipe from toronto star. the original recipe called for
  chicken wings and with the skin left on. we believe however after we made it
  with the skin on that it would be better with the skin off. you can do it
  either way and let me know what you prefer.the flavour of the parmesan comes
  thru very nicely.
