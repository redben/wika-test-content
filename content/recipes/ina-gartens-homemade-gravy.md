  So last night i baked some pork chops for dinner.  i decided this was the
  perfect opportunity for trying out the barefoot contessa’s homemade gravy
  recipe. it was delicious…fattening, but delicious.  now, i comfort myself with
  the idea that we had baked pork chops, dry bread, green beans and instant
  potatoes (i should be ashamed, i suppose) so the gravy was my one indulgence. 
  it was worth it.
