description: >-
  This is an elegant-looking cake and one bite will have you sold! please use
  the very best white chocolate that you can find.this is a cake that has to
  "stand alone" on the merits of the white chocolate, so if you're going to use
  the cheaper stuff, please pass this cake up. if you can find the clear
  vanilla, it's really worth it. i didn't list it but it really makes a
  difference. it's sometimes hard to find,but it won't do any harm using the
  regular. this was in mass recipes.
