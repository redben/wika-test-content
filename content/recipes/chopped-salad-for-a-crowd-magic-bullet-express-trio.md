description: >-
  This is a magic bullet express trio recipe from their website. they don’t
  always give information like how much it makes/servings, cook times, etc. so i
  apologize if my guessing is off.  i’m posting because of the quantity of magic
  bullet requests. i don’t have this machine but if you need an explanation of
  the parts and usage, go their website: www.bulletexpress.com.  this recipe
  doesn’t have any seasonings added, so use your favorite dressing to add
  flavor.  add your favorite veggies too…enjoy! they recommend you prepare this
  just before serving.
