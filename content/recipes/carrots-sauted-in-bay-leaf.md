 - Add oil to large non stick skillet
 - Swirl to coat
 - Add bay leaves to infuse the oil
 - Add carrots and water
 - Partially cover the pan and cook for 10 minutes until carrots are almost tender
 - Add salt and pepper to taste , increase heat to medium-high and cook for approximately 4 minutes , until carrots are tender and lightly browned
 - Stir frequently
 - These directions are so easy , they can be adjusted for time , amount of bay leaves , etc
 - I have also used with sage and rosemary
 - All variations are delicious !
 - If you like a softer carrot , cook longer , shorter time for more crunch
