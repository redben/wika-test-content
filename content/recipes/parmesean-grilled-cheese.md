  It was late and i was craving comfort food, but didnt want the same ol' same
  ol' grilled cheese. i wanted somthing cheesier... and rich... and salty. i
  searched a few recipes and this is what i came up with.... simply
  scrumptious.  id even go so far as to dare say it would be even better with
  some caramelized onions.... next time!
