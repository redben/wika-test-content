  A lovely, filling soup with sweet and spicy flavors from the sweet corn and
  spices.  i found this in a dairy favorites card at the grocery and made a few
  tweaks for our preferences.  you can also sub white cannellini beans for the
  great northern - i just find it easier to locate the great northerns in my
  area.
