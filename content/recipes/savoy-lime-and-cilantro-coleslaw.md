 - Shave the cabbage with a sharp knife or mandoline so you have thin ribbons
 - Cut the scallions long and on the bias so you have pieces similar in shape to the cabbage
 - Toss the cabbage , scallions and cilantro in a large salad bowl
 - Make the dressing by combining the sour cream , mayonnaise , sugar and the zest of the limes in a medium bowl
 - Season with salt and pepper and finish with a squeeze of lime juice
 - Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss to combine
