 - Mince garlic and cut peppers into pieces a food processor can handle
 - Process garlic , peppers , mayo , and olive oil
 - Salt and pepper to taste
 - You can either use roasted peppers in a jar or make them yourself
 - I make them myself
 - I roast in a 450 degree oven for about 30 minutes
 - After they have cooled , i remove the skin
 - Sometimes the skin comes off easily if you put them in a ziploc bag after they have cooled a little
