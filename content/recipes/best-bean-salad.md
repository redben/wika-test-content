description: >-
  My version of a recipe found on another site. this is my go to bean salad.
  great over a bed of lettuce or over cold rice.since manufacturers are
  constantly reducing can sizes, if your can sizes vary a bit that is fine.
  prepare ahead because this should be refrigerated for at least 2 hours (8 is
  preferable). this is reflected in the cooking time.

 - In a large bowl , toss together the salad veggies
 - In a separate bowl , whisk together the dressing ingredients until the sugar is dissolved and pour over the veggies
 - Refrigerate for several hours
 - I think it tastes best after being refrigerated several days
