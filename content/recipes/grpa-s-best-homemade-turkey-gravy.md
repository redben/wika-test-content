  I don’t throw the word “best’ out lightly, but this is seriously the best
  gravy that i’ve ever did. you’ll just want to ladle yourself a bowl full of
  gravy and just eat it like soup. it’s luscious, delicate and has so many
  dimensions of flavor. i make this gravy simultaneously with turkey, so it’s
  best if it’s made together. however, you can certainly replicate it using
  butter and chicken broth.

 - This recipe is made together with roast turkey , and the turkey fat and drippings that render out while the turkey is roasting in the oven
 - Strain the turkey liquid and the vegetables through a fine mesh sieve , pressing on the vegetables to get out as much juice out of them as possible
 - Discard the vegetables
 - They did their job
 - Set the turkey drippings aside for about 5 minutes
 - The fat will rise to the top
 - If you have a gravy separator , this would be the time to use it
 - Carefully spoon the fat into a small saucepan
 - You should have approximately cup of the turkey fat
 - If your turkey is on the leaner side , or youre cooking a wild turkey , add additional butter or oil , to have cup
 - You should also have about 2 cups of turkey liquid , if not , add more broth , to equal 2 cups
 - You can also add a splash of white wine
 - I normally add wine to most of my gravies and sauces , but in this case , the gravy is so flavorful , i dont think it needs it
 - Heat up the fat until its simmering
 - Add the flour and whisk to combine
 - Cook for about a minute , to cook off the raw flour taste
 - Slowly pour in the turkey liquid , whisking the whole time
 - Bring it to a simmer and keep slowly adding more turkey liquid or chicken broth , whisking the whole time
 - Simmer the gravy until it thickens , about 5 minutes
 - Set aside
 - Serve with mashed potatoes and turkey
 - You can easily reheat the gravy , if you make it ahead of time
 - It will thicken significantly with time , so if youre serving it the next day , you may wish to add more chicken broth to thin it out
