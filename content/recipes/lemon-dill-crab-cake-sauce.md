  Excellent on paula deen's crab cakes.  cooking time is sitting time for
  flavors to meld!  as a note:  this is also my spread for turkey burgers i just
  cut the buttermilk down to 1 tbsp.  my husband loves it!  also, the lemon and
  garlic amounts are up to you.  we love garlic, so i usually add 2 cloves!
