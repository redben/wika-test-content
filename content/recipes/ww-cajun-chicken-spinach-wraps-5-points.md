description: >-
  Ww friendly. similar to the ww site chicken wrap, but with more spice and
  perfect for leftovers. the cajun spice is very robust, and with the addition
  of cayenne, this is a real zinger. ww counter figures 5 points, but by using
  smaller "mission" 6 1/2" carb blance tortillas i think it's closer to 4
  points, you could also sub fat free mayo, skip the evo and sub cooking spray.
