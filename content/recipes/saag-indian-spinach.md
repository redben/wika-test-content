  An indian spinach dish similar to that served in indian restaurants.  this is
  great as a main course or served as part of a larger meal.  serve with basmati
  rice and a little raita if you like.  the dish is also great with the addition
  of paneer cubes or boiled potatoes - though i love it plain.

 - In a large saucepan , saute onion in oil on medium high along with ginger and garam masala until onions are translucent and begin to pick up some color
 - Add minced garlic to pan , and cook briefly to soften
 - Do not allow the garlic to burn - lower heat if necessary
 - Add tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes
 - Incidentally , you can add a little more or less tomato depending on what you have available , slight differences in quantity will not be noticeable
 - Stir in yogurt
 - Do not worry if the yogurt separates
 - Add curry powder , coriander , cumin , sugar , and salt
 - Add bag of frozen spinach and mix well to combine
 - There is no need to defrost first if you use a the bagged spinach
 - If you are using the frozen block , i would advise defrosting first
 - You can also use the equivalent of fresh spinach
 - Add about a cup of water to the pot and cover
 - Simmer on medium for approximately 30 minutes
 - Spinach is done when the color has changed from the initial bright green to a much less vibrant green
 - If you crank up the heat , it is possible to cook this a little faster , but you have to pay attention to the moisture level
 - You may have to add more water throughout the cooking process if it cooks off
 - Once the spinach is fully cooked , remove the lid and cook off any remaining liquid
 - The spinach should be moist , but there should not be much liquid free in the bottom of the pan
 - Remove pan from heat
 - Using an immersion blender , blender , or food processor , puree the spinach
 - Leave it as chunky as you like
 - You can also choose to puree only half of the mixture if you like bigger pieces of spinach
 - Add further salt to taste
 - I have found that i have to fine tune the spices every time i make this dish depending on how i feel that day
 - For me , adding further small amounts of coriander is the key
 - If you like , potatoes , paneer cubes or chick peas may be added at this point
 - I recommend combining the components of each step beforehand so that you can just dump everything in quickly as you go
