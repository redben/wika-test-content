  I love the smokey flavor of poblanos, but sweet peppers may be substituted. 
  adjust the amount of sweet peppers used if very large.  poblanos are smaller. 
  don't leave off a dollop of sour cream for it mellows the taste. a dish to be
  ready in 30 minutes for your own fiesta.  from home made simple.
