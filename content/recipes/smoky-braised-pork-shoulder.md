description: "Got this from better homes and gardens. this is really, really good! let it go the full 5 1/2 hours and it will just melt. i left out the shaved chocolate and parsley garnishes, as well as the cumin and garlic because i was out. don't be scared of the cocoa, it doesn't taste like chocolate covered pork, i promise! ideas for the leftovers:\r\ni added cumin, rotel, and chicken broth to the leftover sauce to make enchiladas with mole sauce with some of the leftovers; i also added bbq sauce to more leftovers to make traditional pulled pork sandwiches."
