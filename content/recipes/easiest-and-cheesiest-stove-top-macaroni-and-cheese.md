  This is my grandmother's recipe.  i have no idea where it originated, but i
  don't ever remember a family gathering growing up when this was not served. it
  is not a gourmet macaroni and cheese, but it is fast and good.  the only thing
  anyone ever says after eating it is "may i have some more please?".
