  There are a lot of versions of this recipe out there but this is the one i've
  grown up with and the one that i believe is the best. you can add pretty much
  any fruit you prefer, it's extremely versatile. this can also be done with
  sugar free ingredients and still tastes great. serving sizes are rough
  estimates. cook time is chilling time.
