 - Mix all ingredients into a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat
 - Lower heat to a medium-low heat and cook covered for approx 50 minutes stirring after 25 minutes let stand 15 minutes
 - Rice and lentils should be tender
 - What i like to do is put pot back on burner for a few minutes after it has sat and kind of mash lentils into the rice
 - This gives it a creamier texture
 - This can also be done when you are ready to reheat at a later time
 - Just reheat in pan and lentils will mash as you stir
