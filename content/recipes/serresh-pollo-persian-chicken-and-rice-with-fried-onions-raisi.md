description: "This was my introduction to persian cuisine. my dh's first wife is iranian, and she taught him persian cooking. he can make several awesome dishes, but this was the first he made after moving i with me, and it still is one of my favourites. it's easy and quick to make, too.\r\nbarberries are available in oriental groceries. they are very tart and balance the sweet raisins perfectly.\r\nit's not exactly calorie friendly, but worth every bite. serve with green salad."
