description: >-
  When my twins were two years old i was working evenings. they loved pasta and
  cheese and it was easy for my hubby to fix. but by itself it is not too
  healthy. i devised a series of recipes based on a box (or two) of shells and
  cheese and various cans of food. the shells and cheese called for in these
  recipes are the kind with the cheese sauce, not the powder kind.
