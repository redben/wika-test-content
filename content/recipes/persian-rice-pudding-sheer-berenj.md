  This is my favorite rice pudding. it is nice and creamy but not too heavy. the
  persian version of rice pudding is very simplistic, yet beautiful in flavor
  masha allah. sheer berenj on its own is simply made with rice, water, milk and
  rosewater. i love it because it is not too sweet you add a sweet topping such
  as a good honey or a sweet preserve (jam). modified from a recipe found on
  http://mypersiankitchen.com.
