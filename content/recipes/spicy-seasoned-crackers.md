description: "Salty, spicy, garlicky. an easy and cheap snack to stir up and share with friends (or keep to yourself) - that doesn't taste cheap. \r\ni made this recipe because the other ones on this site called for dill, a different size bag of crackers and had no spice. i do like heat."

 - Heat crackers in the microwave on 1 / 2 power till they are quite hot
 - Heat the oil and butter till it's hot and drizzle it onto the crackers in thirds , stirring between additions
 - Dust on the seasonings and mix well
 - (if you use pure canola oil , you do not need to heat the crackers and fats to make the fats soak inches
 - Knosh till your covered in salt and parsley and your lips burn like fire
 - I just killed a bowl of this and 10 minutes later found myself absently dipping my fingers into an empty bowl
 - Addictive stuff and would be great to give away for holiday treats or serve with drinks before dinner
 - Clarified butter will be free of the residual liquids that would make your crackers soggy
