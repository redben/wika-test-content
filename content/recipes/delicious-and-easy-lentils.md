  Don't let the ease of the recipe fool you - it is fabulous! i got this recipe
  from my mom and it is one of my absolute favorite lentil dishes (i often
  double it). it can also easily be made into a vegetarian (omit canadian bacon)
  or vegan (omit the canadian bacon/cheese and use olive oil in place of butter)
  dish.
