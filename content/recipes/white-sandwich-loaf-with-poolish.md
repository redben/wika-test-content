title: White Sandwich Loaf With Poolish
date: 2011-03-11T00:00:00.000Z
description: "A good portion of the flour in this recipe is fermented before the dough is made to better convert the flour to sugars and generally improve the flavor.  this pre-ferment is called a poolish and is allowed to bubble and develop a nice aroma and flavor.\r\nthis recipe is my take on syd's white sandwich bread from another site.\r\nwhile the process can take up to 3 days, the active time making the bread is the normal amount of time, long resting periods are added to improve flavor."
