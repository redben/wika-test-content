  A relative of colonel harland sanders inherited a family photo album and found
  well hidden the recipe for the secret 11 spices.  kfc denies it is correct,
  although relative says it is.  it's been taste tested and compared to the kfc
  restaurant's chicken and it is spot on.  prep time includes soaking and
  sitting time of chicken.
