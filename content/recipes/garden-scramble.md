  How many times have i found myself the owner of a hodge-podge of
  vegetables....a little bit of this and a little bit of that?  usually i throw
  the bits and pieces into a soup, or end up making vegetable stock.  but this
  time, i had guests, and had to feed them breakfast....so i ended up with this,
  served with canadian bacon and toast!  feel free to change out the veggies,
  using what you have! **if you find yourself the proud owner of some leftover
  roasted veggies...just heat them up and use those and skip the first
  step...they work wonderfully!
