description: >-
  From "the indian slow cooker" by anupy singla. goa was originally colonized by
  the portuguese. coconut milk is used frequently in goan cuisine. this was a
  really delicious meal, although i am not sure about the quantity of water, see
  note. use a 5 qt slow cooker for full amount, a 3 1/2 qt cooker if you halve
  the recipe.

 - Put the black-eyed peas in the slow cooker - no need to presoak
 - Peel and chop the tomatoes
 - Grind together the tomatoes , onion , ginger , garlic and chiles in a food processor
 - Add to slow cooker
 - Add the coriander , salt , turmeric , cumin and sugar to the slow cooker
 - Add the water and give it a stir
 - Cook on high for 7 hours
 - Just before it's done , stir in the coconut milk and let it heat through , about 10 minutes
 - Garnish with cilantro
 - Serve with bread , naan , or rice , or on its own as a soup
 - My peas cooked much more quickly than indicated , perhaps they were very fresh and just did not absorb as much water
 - When making again , i will reduce water and report back
