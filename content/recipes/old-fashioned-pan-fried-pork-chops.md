  I thought it was time to revisit on old-fashioned cooking method: pan frying. 
  is it time to bring it back? go into any of the wonderful family-style
  restaurants in the south and order a pan-fried pork chop, and you are served a
  thing of beauty. for some reason, this no-fuss, easy method has fallen out of
  favor with home cooks (maybe because most recipes are so vague..."season pork
  chop, cook in frying oil until done".)  follow my instructions and you will
  yield a beautifully browned, moist chop...serve with macaroni & cheese and
  some greens, and you will have a fast, old-fashioned weeknight supper.:)
