description: >-
  From our latest issue of sunset magazine, june 2011. fresh, quality
  ingredients are of utmost importance. don't like oregano? substitute another
  fresh herb: cilantro, marjoram, french tarragon, etc. perfect for summer
  potlucks, a casual meal, brunch... the recipe introduction in the magazine
  mentions "the salad is good with grilled halloumi cheese tucked between the
  tomato slices." yes, sounds good to me!
