description: "This is an iraqi dish thought to have originated in iran.  it's tangy and sweet and is a special treat in my family.  i have not included the directions for making the rice as i sometimes use a rice cooker and at other times i make it steamed the traditional way.  either way is fine.\r\nsour salt, also called citric acid crystals looks like sugar and can be found in most stores.  careful, it is very potent.\r\nthe weight of the apricots is a guess.  it is one box or bag of dried apricots as packaged in the stores."
