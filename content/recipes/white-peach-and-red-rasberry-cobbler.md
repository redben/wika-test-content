description: >-
  The bases for this recipe is from dori sanders' country cooking;easy peach
  cobbler. white peaches are a favorite of mine for there delicate taste. i put
  these together one day when i didn't have enough peaches to make it and have
  never gone back to plain peach again! if you home grind your flour use hard or
  soft white wheat or a mixture.the batter bubbles up thru the fruit, just
  remember don't stir it together at any point.

 - Melt butter into 13"x9"x2" baking pan
 - In a medium size bowl combine the flour , 1 cup of the sugar , baking powder , salt , and mix well
 - I add maybe a 1 / 4 tsp of cinnamon , a couple grates of nutmeg and some mccormick orange peel to this to give it a little more flavor than plain dough
 - Stir in the milk , don't over mix , just till combined
 - Pour this over the melted butter in the pan , do not stir them together
 - In a sauce pan , add the peaches , 1 / 2 cup sugar , lemon juice and bring to a boil over medium high heat , stir gently but constantly
 - After reach a boil pour the peaches over the butter and dough in the pan
 - Again do not stir them together
 - Scatter the rasberries over the pan evenly
 - Cook at 375 for about 40-45 minutes , or untill top is golden brown
 - Best hot
 - Great with vanilla ice cream also
