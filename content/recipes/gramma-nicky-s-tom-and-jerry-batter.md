  This recipe has been in my family for 3 generations.  i've been making it for
  40 years.  it makes a wonderful fluffy batter that keeps in the refrigerator
  for about week, but it never lasts that long at my house.  for health reasons,
  make sure you add the egg yolks while the mixture is still very warm.  enjoy!
