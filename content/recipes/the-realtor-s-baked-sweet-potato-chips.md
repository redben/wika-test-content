description: >-
  These are much healthier than fried chips and they taste great.  you can vary
  the flavor by using different spices.  try taco seasoning, garlic, cinnamon...
  the variations are endless.  we like them with just salt and pepper.  the
  thickness you make them will greatly effect the baking time.  if you do them
  with a vegetable peeler, they'll take about 20 minutes.  if you slice them in
  super thin slices, they'll take about 30 minutes.  just watch them until you
  get them just right.
