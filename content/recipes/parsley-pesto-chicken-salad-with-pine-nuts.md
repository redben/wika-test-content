description: >-
  A summer salad i pulled together--i really wanted basil pesto, but the basil
  wasn't ready to be picked!  prep time assumes you got a ready-cooked chicken
  on hand, otherwise add an hour and a half (cook/cool time).

 - Separate chicken from bones and chop or shred to desired consistency
 - Salt and pepper if needed
 - In a food processor , blender , or mini prep food processor whirl together parsley , garlic , drizzling in olive oil until it is a nice thick liquid consistency
 - You can add a little water water to make sure it will coat all the chicken--the recipe amounts are general
 - Stir in the cheese , add salt and pepper if needed
 - Toss together the tomatoes with the chicken and lemon juice
 - Sprinkle the top with the cheese , parlsey and pine nuts
 - You could probably 'tart this up' a little by mixing in a little dijon to the pesto or even mayonnaise , just a thought , i've not tried it
