 - Heat the oil in a large , heavy bottomed pot set over medium heat , just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pot
 - Drop a few kernels of corn in the oil to test the heat
 - When they begin to pop , pour in the rest of the corn , and cover with a tight fitting lid
 - Shake the pan while the corn pops to keep it from burning , about 5-8 minutes
 - Whisk together the parmesan cheese , smoked paprika , garlic powder , salt , sugar , pepper and cayenne in a small bowl
 - Pour the popcorn into a large bowl , and drizzle with butter
 - Sprinkle with the seasoning mix to taste , and toss thoroughly
 - You can use all the seasoning in one batch or start with half and work your way up , depending on how much flavor you want
 - Enjoy !
