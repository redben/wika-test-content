description: >-
  Use shrimp or scallops (or a combination) in this delicious sauce flavored
  with basil, garlic, and oil.  you can also use the sauce on poached salmon or
  whitefish, too.  i like to serve this over pasta with some sauteed whole
  mushrooms and a tossed green salad.  be sure not too cook the seafood too long
  or it will toughen.  this recipe is easily halved or doubled.
