  I'm not a big pork fan, but these chops are great! i love that they're breaded
  and then seared in olive oil. it helps to keep the breading in place and makes
  it crunchy, even after baking it in the oven. you can add pretty much whatever
  you want to the stuffing to make them work for your family. this is delicious
  with onion cheddar mashed potatoes and corn. i hope you like them!
