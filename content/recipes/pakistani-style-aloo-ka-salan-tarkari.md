description: "This is the most basic way of making potatoes in karachi, pakistan. its best served with \"hara raita\" & roti/chapati. \r\n\r\nsome people also serve it with daal chawal as a side dish. me & my siblings are all grown ups now but this is one dish we request our mother to make when we visit her. lets just say this is our comfort food along some other pakistani dishes. \r\n\r\nnote: if you are not big on spicy/hot food then you can adjust the amount of red chili powder."
