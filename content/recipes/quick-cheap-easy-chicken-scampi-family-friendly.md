  I wanted a copycat version of olive garden's chicken scampi but wanted it to
  be quick and easy. so i took a several different chik scampi recipes and made
  one of my own.  even my picky 8y/o liked this, even though he picked out the
  bell peppers. :)   it may look like a lot of ingredients but sooooo easy!
