description: >-
  This is a nice salad dish for the holiday season or special dinner. much of
  this can be made ahead...a real time-saver! they suggest saving the poaching
  liquid for a spiced-wine spritzer or served warm as mulled wine. i tried the
  wine spritzer and it was very refreshing. from bon appetit december, 2009.
