  From a newsletter i get regularly from grandparents.com, this recipe was
  described as "a little bite of cheese, a little bite of sweetness, a little
  bite of crispy & a whole lot of delicious". just when you think dips have
  about used up all their originality, along comes a recipe like this to
  convince you otherwise. (time includes 5 min to crisp the bacon while you
  prepare the dates) *enjoy* !
