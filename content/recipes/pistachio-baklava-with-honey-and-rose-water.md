 - In a saucepan , heat the water , sugar , honey and lemon juice until it comes to the boil and cook for a minute
 - Now add the orange blossom and rose waters , boil for a few seconds , and remove from the heat
 - Allow to cool before using on the baklava
 - Preheat the oven to 200c
 - Grind the nuts
 - We want them to be medium-fine if they are ground too finely , the resulting filling will be very dense
 - Combine with the sugar and cinnamon , then add the orange blossom and rose waters and mix well
 - Set aside
 - In a dish , brush the base with a little melted butter , then add a sheet of filo
 - Brush with butter , then add another sheet
 - Brush with butter , and continue until you have six sheets of filo in the dish
 - Add the filling , and spread out
 - Be gentle so you dont break the pastry
 - Now add the rest of the pastry , in each case adding a layer , brushing with melted butter , then adding the next
 - Finish by brushing the sixth sheet with butter
 - Cut the baklava into pieces long rectangles , diamonds , squares , or whatever whimsical shapes take your fancy
 - Do this carefully with a sharp knife and make sure to go all the way through to the base
 - You might want to leave a border of scrap baklava where the pastry is a bit untidy at the edges
 - This means the final result is neater , and as the cook , you get to enjoy this angels share
 - Bake the baklava for 15-20 minutes until crisp and golden
 - When done , remove from the oven , allow it to sit for a minute , then pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava
 - Be sure to get the syrup in between each cut
 - If you see syrup forming pools in some areas , dont worry it will all be absorbed
 - Allow the baklava to cool fully before serving
 - Decorate with chopped pistachios and dried pomegranate seeds
 - By this , i mean the lightly aromatic rose water
 - If you have the much more intense rose extract , then use just a few drops and not a whole tablespoon !
 - To dry pomegranate seeds remove the red seeds from the white pith , and spread on a non-stick baking tray
 - Leave in the oven at 60c for several hours until the seeds are dry
 - They will remain slightly sticky but should keep their colour and not turn brown
