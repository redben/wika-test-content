title: Easy Homemade Carob Chocolate Sugar Dairy Free

description: >-
  This recipe is great for those who can't eat chocolate (or cocoa) and those
  who like carob! no need to add sugar - carob is naturally sweet. if you want
  to be creative you could create carob "chocolates", dip strawberries, make
  edible lace, or paint the mixture into plastic moulds to make easter eggs. the
  catch? once set you'll have to eat this carob quickly - coconut oil melts at
  warmer temperatures (mine was liquid during the steamy sydney summer). this
  recipe works best if your coconut oil is firm (not liquefied) when stored at
  room temperature. once set, keep your carob "chocolate" creation in the fridge
  until it's ready to be consumed. from the sister-team at sketch-free vegan

 - Sift carob powder into a medium bowl
 - Slowly stir in melted coconut oil , taking care to break up any lumps as you mix ingredients together
 - Spread mixture thinly on a flat surface lined with foil or parchment and allow to cool in fridge
 - Alternatively , you can drizzle into shapes or set the mixture in chocolate moulds
 - Once set , chop or break carob block into smaller pieces
 - Store in a fridge or a cool place until ready to use
 - I read one suggestion that these could be used as chips in baked goods but i'm a little sceptical and think this might require some experimentation
 - Try waiting until baked goods have cooled so that the chips harden up again ?
