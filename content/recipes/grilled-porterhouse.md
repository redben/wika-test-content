 - In a bowl , combine the first six ingredients and rub both sides of the steak with equal amounts of the mixture
 - Let marinade for 1 to 2 hours
 - Set aside and prepare the grill to medium hot
 - Drain liquid from the steak and rub both sides of the steak with salt
 - Grill the steak on one side for 7 to 10 minutes , keeping the smaller tenderloin section over a less intense heat
 - If there are flare-ups , move the steak to another part of the grill that is cooler
 - Turn the steak and grill for another 6 to 7 minutes
 - It should be rare to medium rare at this point
 - Medium is about 10 minutes per side
 - Transfer the steak to a wooden carving platter and let it rest for 3 to 4 minutes so the meat relaxes and the juices redistribute
 - Serve it whole or else carve it , slice it , and reassemble it , saving the juices to pour over it
 - Fight over who gets which piece of the steak
 - Lol
