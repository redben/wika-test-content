  We had a bumper crop of garlic this year and i drove myself nuts trying to
  find the best way to preserve the flavor all year! i tried roasting it but
  that didn't work for all recipes. i worried about spoilage and botulism when
  stored in oil. i read that storing in vinegar gives an acidic flavor to some
  recipes! ugh! i came across this method an an agriculture site! not only was
  this easy from start to finish it was convenient too! the only real work
  involved is peeling the garlic but that went fast while watching a show of tv
  or maybe even visiting with a friend- who can share the job! the system
  requires an amount of garlic so i used 1 head but use as much garlic as you
  like. of course, there is no substitute for the flavor and texture of fresh,
  raw garlic! i found that this method preserves the flavor best imho. enjoy!

 - Remove papery husk from garlic and peel each clove
 - Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil
 - Place peeled garlic in a single layer on the covered cookie sheet
 - Place in freezer for at least one hour
 - Remove cookie sheet with frozen individual cloves and place garlic cloves in a plastic zip top bag , now you can remove one or more cloves as your recipes directs
 - Garlic cloves do not become mushy and hold their shape well but are softer than fresh
 - I have used the frozen cloves in lots of ways from smashing them into a paste to slicing and chopping the cloves
 - The flavor stays nicely as well
