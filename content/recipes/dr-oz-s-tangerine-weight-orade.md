description: >-
  This is dr. oz's recipe for a powerful metabolism-boosting drink.  according
  to dr. oz, green tea is shown to boost metabolism 12% by drinking just one
  cup; tangerine contains a chemical composition that increases sensitivity to
  insulin and stimulates genes that help to burn fat, and mint is a calorie-free
  flavor enhancer.  drink 1 pitcher daily for maximum metabolism-boosting
  results.  i believe this can't hurt and can only promote good health.  5/2/13
  again, the recipe is meant to be a metabolism booster and because it's not
  loaded with sugar or sugar substitutes it will not be a sweetened drink.  it's
  aim is health benefits and hoped it will judged as such.
