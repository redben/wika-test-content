  Kari hall says, "this recipe is so delicious and easy to make.  i come from a
  really swedish town - rockford, illinois - where swedish pancakes are a
  favorite for sunday morning breakfast.  my dad used to make these for us at
  home for a special treat.  serve with butter and maple syrup, or lingonberries
  if you've got them."  from allrecipes.com.
