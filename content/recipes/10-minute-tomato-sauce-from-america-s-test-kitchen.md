date: 2010-06-15T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  Fresh tasting pasta sauce using canned crushed tomatoes as described on
  america's test kitchens. use either muir glenn or tuttoroso crushed tomatoes
  because they use a lower processing temperature in the canning process and
  therefore are fresher tasting than other brands.  recipe notes:  according to
  the chefs, grating the onions instead of chopping allows them to carmelize
  more quickly. the butter is used because saturated fats helps the onions stay
  sweet. olive oil contains  unsaturated fats that react with an enzyme in the
  onion that can result in a bitter taste. using crushed tomatoes is preferable
  to other forms. the chefs apparently expended a great deal of effort in
  developing this simple recipe so it is suggested that it be followed closely
  in order to acheive a fresh tasting sauce from canned tomatoes.
