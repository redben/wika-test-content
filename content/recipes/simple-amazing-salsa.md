  This is probably the easiest salsa to make and it is so amazingly good! if you
  really want to add a kick to it use tinned tomatoes with habanero! and if you
  like garlic, toss in a few extra cloves- i usually use one giant clove which
  is probably equal to 2-4 regular cloves. yumm! this salsa is so addictive!
