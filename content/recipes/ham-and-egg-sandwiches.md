 - Fry your eggs on medium-high heat
 - Cook them scrambled or sunny-side-up
 - When eggs are done , place them on the bread
 - Put on the ham and cheese
 - Put the bread together to form a sandwich
 - Melt the butter in a sauce pan
 - Place the assembled sandwich into the pan
 - Cook it like it's grilled cheese !
 - Plate and serve
 - If serving young children , cut the sandwich in two so the pieces are easier for small hands
