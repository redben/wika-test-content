  This is a vegetarian recipe i found on a website i frequent (or at least it
  was billed as vegetarian - i'm not one myself, so please don't shoot the
  messenger if there's something in here that makes it not vegetarian!). i
  haven't tried it yet, but it sounds good, so i thought i'd write it down where
  i wouldn't lose it! and i'm not normally a big fan of tofu, but i've used it
  to make desserts before, and they've turned out really well, so i reckon this
  one is worth a try.  servings and prep time are estimates, and cooking time
  includes refrigeration time.
