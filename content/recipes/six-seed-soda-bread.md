description: >-
  One of the farmers markets sells this very heavy dense bread that is chocked
  full of seeds. well it is kind of expensive at $4.00 a loaf, so started
  playing around with some soda bread recipes and came up with this which is
  close. this is a heavy dense bread that only slices well when cold but tastes
  better  warm. we enjoy it slightly warm with either plain or with flavored
  butter.*the dough is very sticky see notes in directions*

 - Combine the flours , baking powder , salt , baking soda , and brown sugar in a large bowl
 - Add all but 2 tablespoons of the seeds
 - Stir the sour milk / buttermilk into the dry ingredients just to blend
 - Turn out dough on to a well floured board and knead about 5 times , just enough to pull it together into a loose ball

 - Brush with a little milk and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of seeds
