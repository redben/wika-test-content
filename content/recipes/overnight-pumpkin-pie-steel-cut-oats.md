  Who doesn't love pumpkin pie for breakfast? i love steel cut oats, but as a
  teacher and trainer, i don't have time to cook them in the morning. i did a
  lot of experimenting and came up with the following recipe for overnight oats
  in the fridge. before i leave for work, i grab my jar of oats, put it in my
  bag, and head for the gym. i heat it up as soon as i hit work and i've got
  pumpkin pie for breakfast.

 - I make up five of these on the weekend by putting oats , flax seeds , and spice into pint canning jars and putting the lids on them
 - They sit in the cupboard
 - Every night i heat up half cup water until about tea water temperature
 - Doesn't have to be boiling
 - Alternatively , you can just add water , pumpkin , and maple syrup and put into microwave for 2 minutes
 - Put lids on jar and put into fridge
 - In the morning , add about 1 tbs half and half or a little milk or almond milk and head for 90 seconds
 - Stir , eat
 - One of the benefits of the soaking is that the flax actually puffs up and becomes digestible so you don't need to grind it
 - Other add ins or options: coconut , raisins or other dried fruit , nuts , hemp hearts , chia seeds , , peanut butter and cocoa , fresh berries , pears or apples with apple pie spice , etc
