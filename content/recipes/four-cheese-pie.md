  A super easy recipe from australian women's weekly 'winter favorites' magazine
  from 2007. the original recipe calls for blue cheese as opposed to feta, but i
  don't care for it so i sub it. this is always a crowd pleaser. i love serving
  this as either an appetizer or as a main with a side of salad. enjoy!
