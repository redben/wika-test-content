description: >-
  This is the simplest recipe for pea salad. my mom use to make this for us when
  we were growing up, now i make it for my family and everyone enjoys it. it
  only takes a few minutes to throw together, but adds a nice touch to many
  meals, especially bbq's and family gatherings. i prefer to make this with
  green onion, but i have used white onion, or even no onion, depending on what
  i have on hand. i hope you enjoy the recipe.
