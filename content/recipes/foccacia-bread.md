  This is the most delicious foccacia bread i've had, and i'm very grateful to
  the friend who gave me this recipe. there are endless ways to make it
  depending on your favorite toppings of course. i like to add garlic and
  parmesan to the dough, and top with herbs and more cheese. it makes two baking
  sheets full of bread.
