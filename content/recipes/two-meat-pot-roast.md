description: >-
  My old fashion cajun way to make pot roast.  you may want to research your
  roasts.  if you want to cook a roast that just falls all to pieces, choose the
  chuck roast. if you want one that slices well, choose the rump or sirloin
  tip.  i'll cook anything on sale.  the same method can be used for just one
  roast.

 - Prepare the roasts by trimming off any excess fat
 - Make slits with a sharp knife deep enough to insert garlic slivers fully
 - Repeat stuffing garlic into and around both beef and pork roasts
 - Season both roasts generously with salt and pepper or creole-cajun seasoning
 - In a heavy 8-quart dutch oven or cast iron dutch oven , heat the oil and brown the meat , one piece at a time on all sides
 - Browning the roasts well produces a darker and richer gravy
 - Drain off the fat
 - Return both pieces of the meat to the dutch oven
 - Add to the dutch oven the bay leaf and beef boullion
 - Pour into the bottom of the dutch oven 1 1 / 2 cups water , cover and simmer , low , for 2 - 2 1 / 2 hours
 - Turn occasionally and check for "near" doneness
 - You have 30 minutes left -- next step
 - Add the chopped onion , potatoes and carrots
 - Cover and simmer an additional 30 minutes or until tender
 - Remove roasts and vegetables to a platter
 - For every one cup of liquid in the dutch oven , combine 2 tablespoons flour with 2 tablespoons water
 - Stir flour mixture into the liquid , scraping bottom of browned bits and simmering over medium heat until the gravy is smooth and has thickened
 - Taste gravy and season with salt and pepper as needed
 - At this point , i slice the roasts and return it to the pot with gravy along with the onions and / or carrots and potatoes
