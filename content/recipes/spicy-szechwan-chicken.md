description: >-
  This is out of my "hot barbecue" cookbook. it says that if you omit the green
  onions and cilantro you can make a large batch of the marinade and it will
  keep indefinitely in the refrigerator, just add the green onion and cilantro
  to the portion that you use that day. it is excellent on spareribs and
  firm-fleshed fish. serve with fried rice and a salad. the cooking time does
  not include marinating time.
