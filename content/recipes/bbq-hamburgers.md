  My mom did a great job of feeding a family of 6 on a budget. she made the
  ground beef go farther by making it a bit more like meatloaf, then my dad
  would slather on the bbq sauce on the grill. the result are tasty, moist
  hamburgers.

 - In a large mixing bowl , using your hands , combine the ground beef , eggs , breadcrumbs and barbecue sauce / ketchup
 - Add additional sauce or breadcrumbs as needed so that the meat has a meatloaf texture - not dry or too wet , and holds together in a large ball easily
 - Add garlic powder and minced onion and mix well until distributed throughout meat
 - Pinch off about 3 / 4 cup of meat and roll into ball , then flatten with your hands
 - The hamburgers will shrink when cooked , so adjust the size based on your tastes
 - Allow for 4-5 patties per pound
 - Heat outdoor grill
 - Grill patties on one side for about 10 minutes , then flip over when the meat is browned on the underside and some grill marks are visible
 - Using a spoon or brush , cover the cooked side with barbecue sauce
 - Cook until the underside is browned with grill marks and flip again
 - Cover the top with barbecue sauce again
 - Flip one more time and then remove from grill
 - Serve on hamburger bun with your favorite toppings
 - We find it usually takes about 20 minutes total on the grill
 - Cook until the cheese is melted and remove
