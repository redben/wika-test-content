description: "This is the perfect combination of chocolate, peanut butter, and oatmeal. i know it may sound funny, but it tastes out of this world. you can also add chocolate chips, coconut, or any kind of nut. \r\n\r\nwe used smart balance butter instead of margarine and fat free evaporated milk instead to make it less points for weight watchers"
