 - Preheat oven to 375f place paper baking cups into muffin pan

 - Set aside
 - In large bowl , whisk together pumpkin , sugar and brown sugar
 - Beat in eggs , vegetable oil and vanilla extract
 - Slowly whisk in the flour mixture , until there are no lumps
 - Fill muffin tins 3 / 4 full
 - In a medium bowl , beat cream cheese until smooth
 - Add in sugar , egg yolk and vanilla extract and beat until well combined
 - Fill prepared muffin cups
 - Top each muffin with about 1 tablespoon of cream cheese mixture and use a toothpick to swirl it into the batter
 - This will not look smooth , but it will bake up much prettier
 - Bake muffins for 18-20 minutes , or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean
 - I liked these best at room temperature or even slightly chilled
