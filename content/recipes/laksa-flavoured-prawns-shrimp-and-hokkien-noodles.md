  Came across a file pre zaar/food.com days with some recipes i had photostatted
  obviously to try or had tried - this one we tried in march 2005 and i had
  commented "very nice indeed", so i am now saving it here.  all i know is that
  it is page 16 of a cookbook, don't know which one though.  times and servings
  sizes are estimated.
