 - First up , cream together your butter and brown sugar
 - Add in your egg , vanilla , and evaporated milk
 - Mix well and then add in your pudding mix and flour
 - Finally , you'll add in your pumpkin , cinnamon , nutmeg , salt , baking powder , and baking soda
 - Mix up your streusel ingredients
 - The brown sugar , pecans , cinnamon , and nutmeg
 - Pour about half the batter into a 9x11 pan
 - Sprinkle half your streusel mixture over the batter
 - Pour the rest of your batter in the pan and sprinkle the rest of the streusel mixture over the top
 - Pop it in the oven at 350 for 45-50 minutes
 - And let me tell ya , be flexible with the time ! this is a really moist bread so it's imperative that it's cooked all the way through
 - If you need an extra five minutes , by all means take it
 - Just make sure that toothpick comes out clean !
