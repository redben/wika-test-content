description: "Ready, set, cook! hidden valley contest entry.  chicken paprika has been around for a very long time.  my version is a little bit different.  by adding a few more ingredients \"chicken paprikash\" is a whole new experience that everyone raves about. the smoked paprika is hot, so you are warned!  the artichokes are a nice surprise.\r\n\r\nit is easier to cut up the chicken if it is put in the freezer for about 10 minutes. served with rice or noodles and a green salad, it is a complete meal.  enjoy!"
