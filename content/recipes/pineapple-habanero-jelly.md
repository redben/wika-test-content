description: >-
  This is a wonderfully sweet and spicy jelly, perfect poured over cream cheese
  and served with crackers or as a sandwich spread.  i was a little taken back
  when i saw that this recipe called for 15 habaneros, but it is not
  overwhelming hot the sweet pineapple is a perfect balance.  be sure to wear
  rubber gloves or disposable latex gloves when cutting up the habanero peppers
  and don't touch your eyes or mouth - they are hot!
