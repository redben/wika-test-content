description: >-
  I was craving something light, sweet, and smoothie-like tonight but wasn't
  sure what. and then it hit me - a drinkable chocolate chip cookie! i set out
  here on zaar to see what i could find and didn't find much. so, i started
  looking for some edible cookie dough recipes to take inspiration from, and
  this is what i came up with. as the title suggests, i consider this an ongoing
  experiment. feel free to contribute your suggestions! recipe may be doubled,
  tripled, etc. according to the size of your blender.
