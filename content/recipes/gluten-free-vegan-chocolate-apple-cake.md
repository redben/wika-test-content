description: "This is a bit of a work in progress. i made this cake up because i had apples to use up and was craving something chocolate-y. it's quickly made with ingredients which i usually have on hand, and it tastes pretty good, but it's not five-star-terrific yet. so if you choose to try it and come up with suggestions to improve it, i'd be very grateful!\r\ni used erythritol in place of sugar, but of course you can use sugar or xylitol. i think half brown sugar or evaporated cane juice would be very good, too.\r\nwith 2/3 cup sugar it's probably not very sweet, so if you're sweet toothed, use 3/4 cup of sugar or other sweetener.\r\ndon't overbake it or it will get dry. i found that the toothpick should not come out completely clean. the cake is ready when it feels soft and springy pressing the top slightly, 35 minutes in my oven."
