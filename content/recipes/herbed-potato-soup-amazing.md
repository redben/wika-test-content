description: "I found this recipe either on this site (and it's disappeared) or another that i don't remember. i had this recipe memorized last winter! although, over summer, i forgot, so i came looking for it on here recently. since i found my written copy and since i don't see it here anymore, i am going to share it with you! \r\n\r\nwhat's great about this recipe is what you can do with it. i love to add chicken or cauliflower or broccoli or cheese to it at the end. (requires an extra step!)"
