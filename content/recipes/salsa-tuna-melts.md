description: "I felt like having tuna melts tonight, but didn't want just the same old stuff.  (i usually just go for tuna, mayo and lots of black pepper.)  this is what i came up with, and it was pretty darned tasty, if i do say so myself.  hope you like it too!\r\n\r\n(note: prep and cooking times are approximate...i didn't time mine, so i had to guess.)"

 - Toast your bread until it is light golden brown
 - Drain excess liquid from the salsa if it is very juicy
 - Otherwise , the tuna mixture will be too runny , and the toast will become soggy
 - While the bread is toasting , mix the tuna , mayonnaise and salsa in a small bowl
 - Spread some of the tuna mixture on each piece of toast
 - Place slices on a foil-lined pan in the toaster oven and heat until tuna mixture is warmed through , about 3-5 minutes
 - Top each piece with a slice of cheese , and put back in oven until cheese is melted
 - Enjoy !
