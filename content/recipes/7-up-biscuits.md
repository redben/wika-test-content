 - Preheat oven to 450 degrees
 - Cut the sour cream into your biscuit mix
 - "cutting in" is simply incorporating your sour cream , butter or shortening into your dry baking mix without using a mixer
 - You can use a fork , knife , pastry cutter or the tools god gave you , your fingers
 - You just want to make sure that each portion of your {wet} ingredient gets coated with the dry mix
 - Stir in 1 / 2 cup 7 up
 - The dough will be very soft , don't worry
 - Sprinkle additional baking mix on to your counter , about a 1 / 2 cup seems to work just fine
 - Knead and fold dough until coated with your baking mix
 - Pat dough out , and cut biscuits using a round biscuit / cookie cutter
 - Don't have one , no problem , you can certainly use a glass or empty soup can to cut out your biscuits
 - Where there's a will , there's a way ! improvising is fine
 - Melt butter in a 9 inch square pan
 - I stick my pan and butter in the oven for a few minutes
 - Just a few though , the butter will burn , so watch it
 - Place cut biscuits on top of melted butter and bake for 12-15 minutes or until brown
