title: Onion Feta And Zaatar Egg Noodle Kugel
date: 2013-02-05T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  This kugel uses traditional eastern european kugel components but with a
  modern israeli flair...and just happened to be stuff i had stocked the fridge
  and pantry with one night! very easy to double, use half the bag of noodles
  for a little kugel in a 8 x 8 square pan or 9" pie pan, and the whole bag for
  a big kugel in a 9 x 13 pan then simply double everything else. pot cheese
  also works nicely in this if you don't like the tang of feta or goat cheese;
  so long as it's dry and crumbly it'll work.

 - Cook the noodles according to the package directions , i wouldn't recommend more than 7-8 minutes total
 - Drain and set aside
 - If using a block of feta , run it through your food processor or blender a few times to get it nice and crumbled
 - If lacking such an appliance , mashing it up with a fork does the trick too
 - Drain any excess liquid
 - Mix everything in a large mixing bowl , then pour into an oiled 8 x 8 square pan
 - Bake for 45-50 minutes or until golden browned on top
