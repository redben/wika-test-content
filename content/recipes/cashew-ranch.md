title: Cashew Ranch

description: "You could eat this ranch with a spoon and not get sick! the fat and creaminess comes from blended cashews. its so easy to whip up too!\r\n\r\nnote: if you can only get the cashews that are broken up in pieces, they are a little drier than the whole ones, so i would consider soaking them for 2-4 hours. this is also a good idea if you don't have a strong blender, but i find my magic bullet works just great!"
