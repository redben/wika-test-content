description: "A less expensive cut can taste pricey â€” if you know what to look for, chef fabio says. . \r\n\r\ntips: \r\n1. the right cooking technique will improve any piece of meat -- leaner meats are best for roasting or grilling, fattier meat are good for braising and broiling. \r\n2. marbling determines how juicy your steak will be. \r\n3. always let the steak reach room temperature before cooking. \r\nsearing 101: sear at a high heat immediately to crisp the outside of the steak. turn the heat lower once the second side has seared to maintain the melt-in-your mouth pink on the inside. \r\nusing a fresh herb brush to brush oil on to the steak will infuse the steak with amazing fresh flavors."
