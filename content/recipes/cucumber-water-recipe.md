description: "This recipe is from the \"fairmont sonoma mission inn & spa\", in sonoma,california. i always make this with bottled water, or filtered water. it's great if you have company over. a better option than just handing them a regular bottle of water. put into a \r\n\"beverage dispenser jug\" with a spout, so your guests can refill their cups as needed."
