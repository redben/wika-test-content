description: "This is my version of german lentil soup. depending on the lentils you use, the cooking time is something between 20 and 45 minutes. i don't soak the dried lentils overnight but just wash them and then boil them in the soup. also i don't use normal bacon but turkey bacon. if you get beef shank for the meat, that's the perfect cut to prepare the stock, but other cuts suitable for stock are just as good.\r\nyou can make the stock ahead the day before making the lentil,soup."
