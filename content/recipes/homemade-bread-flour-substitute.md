description: >-
  A baking component that often gets pricey-- ap flour is usually cheap and you
  can get generic/storebrand; i've yet to see storebrand bread flour. i got a
  box of vital wheat gluten on the clearance pile at giant-- you can find this
  stuff at health food stores and big grocery stores, or purchase in smaller
  bulk quantities online. this is really convenient for recipes that call for
  only a cup or two of bread flour without necessitating purchasing and storing
  an extra sack that costs around $5-6 just for 5 pounds! the proportion is all
  the same-- 1 tsp gluten to 1 cup flour. if making 1/2 cup, use 1/2 tsp.

 - In a bowl , sift the proportional amounts of vital wheat gluten and ap flour together
 - If you have whole wheat flour , add a little bit for nuttiness and substance as it adds to the weight that makes it better suited for bread and pretzel making
