  Dh and i made this recipe on the bbq last night to accompany grill roasted
  chicken with chimichurri rojo.  from williams-sonoma.  we enjoyed the potatoes
  very much.  we easily halved the recipe, but still used 2 garlic cloves.  we
  also used salted butter and this was fine.

 - Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat
 - Salt the water
 - Add the potato slices and cook until they are slightly softened but not completely tender , about 8 minutes
 - Drain the potatoes well and let cool
 - Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for indirect grilling over medium-high heat
 - Using the side of a chef's knife , smash the garlic cloves and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt
 - Continue smashing and scraping the garlic into a paste
 - In a small saucepan over medium heat , melt the butter
 - Stir in the garlic paste , parsley and thyme , and season with salt and pepper
 - Spray a mesh grill pan with nonstick cooking spray
 - Place 2 potato slices in the center of the grill pan , then create 2 separate rings of potato slices: starting with the inner ring , arrange the slices , slightly overlapping the center slices as well as the previous slice , to create a fanned effect
 - Then form an outer ring of potato slices , slightly overlapping the inner ring
 - Brush the first layer of potatoes with some of the garlic-herb butter and season with salt and pepper
 - Repeat to create a second layer on top of the first one
 - Brush the top layer with garlic-herb butter and season with salt and pepper
