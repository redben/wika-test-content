 - Combine the water , sourdough starter , and one half of the cracked rye
 - Mixture will be soupy
 - Cover and allow to set at about 70 f for 8 to 10 hours
 - After 8 to 10 hours , the mixture will have absorbed water and be similar in consistency to porridge
 - Save 1 cup of this mixture for the next batch of bread , then add salt and the rest of the cracked rye
 - Allow the dough to ferment at about 70 f for 4 more hours
 - At the end of this time , work and squeeze the dough with your hands to develop its cohesiveness
 - The dough is nothing like wheat bread dough
 - It is very moist and slippery and cannot be kneaded
 - When a handful is squeezed , it will squirt out between your fingers
 - After working the dough for several minutes , pack it into bread forms , preferably glass
 - There's not much rising that goes on and too much air space in the bread would be detrimental to the texture
 - The moistness and acidity of the dough and the long baking time will strongly rust steel pans and etch aluminum ones
 - Pack the dough into the pan tightly and smooth the top with a spatula
 - Lay a piece of parchment paper over the top of the form and then cover tightly with aluminum foil
 - The aluminum foil keeps the bread from drying out and the parchment paper keeps the aluminum foil from dissolving into the bread
 - Bake at 225 f for 3 hours
 - Turn the oven off but allow the bread to remain inside for a couple more hours
 - Carefully remove the bread from the pans and place on a rack to cool and dry
 - Ideally , you should wait a day or two until the bread becomes firmer before attempting to slice it
