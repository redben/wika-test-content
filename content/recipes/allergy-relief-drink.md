  Allergies are sooooo annoying! can i hear a amen? but seriously as soon as
  spring comes around for me its terrible and the sneezing, itchy/watery eyes,
  and asthma comes on strong. i am literally allergic to almost everything under
  the sun: grass, weeds, trees, flowers, etc. luckily i’m not allergic to dogs
  that would be heartbreaking. this year since being on a more natural journey i
  wanted to find a natural allergy relief. well that, and my allergy medicine
  ran out and i didn’t want to buy more so i started looking for a natural
  solution. there are more natural solutions than this but this is what i have
  tried so far and what works for me.
