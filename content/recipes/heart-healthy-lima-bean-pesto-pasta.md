  Pesto lovers check this out!  a cholesterol-lowering fiber and protein filled
  pesto. arugula gives this pesto a nice bite if you want more of a kick go
  ahead and add the optional sriracha sauce. the lima beans, cheeses and olive
  oil gives this a butter texture and protein. the lima beans replace the nuts
  in pesto's. you can do 1/2 arugula and 1/2 basil for more of a bite! but be
  sure to use tender baby arugula for it is raw in this recipe. the older the
  tougher and stronger it gets.the cook time is for the pasta. mine was 8
  minutes but cook according to package directions.
