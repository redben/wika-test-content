 - Take 2 large scoops of vanilla ice cream and place on a large piece of plastic wrap
 - Wrap up and mold with hands into a potato shape
 - Put in freezer to set
 - Put cocoa powder into a bowl and roll unwrapped ice cream potato in the powder until completely covered
 - Slice the top of your ice cream potato and pull back edges a bit to make room for your whipped topping and starburst candy butter
 - Shake off excess cocoa powder and place on a plate
 - Top with a dollop of cool whip for the "sour cream"
 - Place your unwrapped yellow starburst candy in the microwave for 10 seconds to soften - then press the edges out to make a larger "pat of butter"
 - Top your potato and enjoy !
