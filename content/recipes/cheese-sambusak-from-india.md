description: >-
  This recipe comes from copeland marks' book sephardic cooking. he attributes
  the recipe to the calcutta area of india. he says that almost all the women
  there knew how to make them and that they are a popular snack to be served
  with coffee or tea. the authentic version uses a home-made type of string
  cheese, but you can substitute the kashkaval, mozzarella or cheddar listed
  below. i have made these several times, with different cheeses and they are
  quite good. if you use kashkaval, i suggest french feta. if you use a less
  strongly flavored cheese, i suggest bulgarian feta. i freeze them and keep
  them on hand for unexpected guests. you just thaw them for an hour on a cookie
  sheet and then reheat them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. prep and cooking
  time does not include one hour of refrigeration needed before assembling and
  baking.
