 - Place the beef , water and a big pinch of salt in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat
 - Reduce heat to low , cover and simmer for 1 to 1 1 / 2 hours , or until the beef is very tender
 - Remove the beef to a bowl , reserving the broth , and set aside to cool
 - When cool enough to handle , shred the beef with your fingers and set aside
 - While the beef is simmering , place the onion , tomatoes , tomatillos and chiles in a food processor or blender and puree , adding a little water if necessary
 - Heat the oil in a large pot over medium flame
 - Add the onion-tomato puree and simmer until the puree is cooked down and darkens somewhat in color , about 10 minutes
 - Do not burn
 - Add the shredded beef and about 3 cups of the broth to the onion-tomato puree and season with salt and pepper
 - Simmer for about 15 minutes
 - Stir in the potatoes , onions and a little more broth or water if necessary simmer until the potatoes and carrots are cooked through , about 15-20 minutes
 - Stir in the breadcrumbs to thicken the sauce
 - Then stir in the chopped cilantro , adjust seasoning and serve hot with corn tortillas or rice
 - Variations
 - Use 1 or 2 shredded fresh corn tortillas to thicken the sauce instead of the breadcrumbs if you like
 - If the sauce has thickened enough while simmering , neither thickener may be necessary
 - Add 2 teaspoon achiote seasoning to the onion-tomato puree for added flavor
 - Bricks of achiote seasoning can be found at many latin markets
 - The potatoes and carrots can be eliminated if you like
 - Canned tomatoes and tomatillos work just fine in this recipe
 - Two cups of chopped tomatoes can be used if you would like to eliminate the tomatillos
 - If you can't find guajillo chiles , use anchos or pasillas
 - Or substitute with 1 tablespoon of paprika and 1 / 4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
