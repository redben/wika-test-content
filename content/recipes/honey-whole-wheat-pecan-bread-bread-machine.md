  I make this bread once a week. everyone seams to love this bread. its my most
  requested. i played with ingredients over and over until i got it right. very
  simple and very good ya too! this creates a very fluffy bread. its almost as
  fluffy as white bread. the trick is the xantham gum and wheat gluten.
