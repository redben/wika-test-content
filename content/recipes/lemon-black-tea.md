description: "Well, this tea blend is great for those lovers of lemony things.  i particularly made this blend because i feel that a lot of commercially available lemon tea blends are overpowering in their lemon-ness.  this one's a bit more restrained in its lemon taste, but still good!\r\n\r\nnote: i've listed things in teaspoons because this website won't let me list it in parts, but it's technically in a ratio, so you can make whatever quantity you want."
