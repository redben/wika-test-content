  Both of my daughters had to submit chocolate recipes for a 5th grade mothers
  day cookbook project.  there were a lot of really good ones, but my favorite
  ended up being two separate recipes that i combined and then added my own
  touches to.  you might think this is way too runny to work, but it ends up
  wonderful!
