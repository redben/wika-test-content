description: "This is my memere's tourtiere recipe, tweaked a bit, but don't tell her that. one does not mess with a french woman's meat pie recipe, lol.\r\nall the men in my family are moose hunters. this is one way we use the ground moose meat. moose meat is very lean so do not cut back on the ground pork."
