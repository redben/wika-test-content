description: >-
  My son john likes a smooth salsa and he and my husband like it extra hot. so
  this is made smooth and spicy, but i take it over the top and raise the heat
  in 3 of the jars by adding more pureed chipotle in adobo sauce. you can skip
  this step by just filling the jars as the recipe calls for,

 - Place all the ingredients except for the pureed tomatoes in a blender and blend till smooth making sure all the garlic in broken down
 - Depending on you blender you may have to do in batches
 - Place all the ingredients in a heavy bottom pot bring to a boil then simmer 15 minutes stirring occasionally
 - Ladle into hot jars leaving 1 / 2 inch headspace
 - Wipe jars and adjust lids and process in water canner for 15 minutes
 - Cool over night , label and store out of sunlight
 - Fyi: an extra step is not necessary but for my family it is ! i saved 3 cups to kick up the heat for my son and husband by adding 3 more pureed chipotles in adobo sauce
 - I did add 2 more tablespoons bottled lemon juice to the remaining three cups
 - And brought back up to a boil then simmered while the other jars were in the water bath , this is extra hot so no need to do unless you have family members like mine that request it hotter !
