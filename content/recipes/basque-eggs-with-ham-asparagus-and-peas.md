 - Finely slice the garlic cloves and fry in 2 tbsp olive oil in a strong earthenware casserole dish
 - Cut the ham into cubes and add to the casserole dish - saut for 5 mins over a low heat

 - Add the peas to the casserole dish cover with a little water and simmer until the peas are almost cooked
 - Finally break the eggs whole into the casserole dish and leave over the heat until the eggs are cooked
