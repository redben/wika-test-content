  This recipe combines some of my favorites!  chicken, avocado, monterey jack
  cheese, and green onions!  this makes some great baked chicken. just make sure
  you pound your chicken breasts so they are an even thickness so it all gets
  done at one time.  my grocery store sells chicken breasts cut thinly that i
  like to use for this and eliminate the pounding. :) i also like to eat these
  on sandwiches, and add the toppings to the sandwiches.
