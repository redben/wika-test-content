description: >-
  To dress up a fresh fruit salad,  top it with a sweet creamy concoction. 'the
  original recipe called for heavy whipping cream, but i lightened it up a
  little,' 'served in a cut-glass bowl, this salad looks elegant on any table.
  it's quick and easy to make but looks like you fussed.'"
