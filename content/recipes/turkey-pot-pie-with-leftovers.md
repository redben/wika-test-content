description: >-
  All that leftover thanksgiving dinner but tired of just leftovers...than try
  this leftover turkey dinner pot pie. i use a variation of veggies depending on
  what we have for the big dinner (this year we used carrots, corn and and
  asparagus). this recipe can be made in small individual size pie pans or in a
  large pie pan as well.  i have taken several recipes and tweaked it to my own
  liking. this can also be prepared in advance and frozen once assembled and
  baked at a later day.
