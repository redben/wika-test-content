  Here in costa rica we have wonderful farmers markets in almost every town. 
  the one where we go, in san isidro de general, the market covers a huge city
  block inside an enormous warehouse.  one of the ladies there grows and sells
  rabbit.  i found this recipe in the essential mediterranean cookbook and it's
  become one of our favorites.  just tell your company it's chicken (just
  kidding...).
