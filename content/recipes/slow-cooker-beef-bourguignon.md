  This is my adaptation of rita's "recipe#54850" #54850 for making it in the
  crock pot for a french love affair challenge in zwt 8/france. i have made no
  changes to the ingredients, only the preparation so that it is suited for the
  crock pot. i reduced the wine by half to adapt this recipe to the crock pot.
  it is a delicious recipe!
