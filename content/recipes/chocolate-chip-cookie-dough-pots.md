  My children love a chocolate chip cookie so gooey on the inside that i can’t
  really make the outside firm enough to let the cookies keep integrity of form.
  this, then, is the solution: a cookie dough you bake in a little dish, and
  then eat with a spoon, dolloped with ice cream or cre?me frai?che as desired.
  i know i blamed my children for them (what else are children for?), but don’t
  think of these just as junior fare: any time you’re having friends over for
  supper and don’t know what to make for pudding, this is the answer. (recipe
