 - Line a mini-muffin pan with mini-muffin paper cups
 - Fill each cup about halfway with rice krispies
 - No real measurement required here
 - Carefully melt the chocolate chips either on stovetop or in the microwave
 - If microwaving , be very careful because culinary chocolate can burn if nuked too hard !
 - When it's a nice stirring consistency , stir in the vanilla and cinnamon
 - While the chocolate is still hot , spoon over the rice krispies , coating them well
 - Gently re-microwave if mixture begins to stiffen
 - Freeze the pan for at least 2 hours prior to eating
