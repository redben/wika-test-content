description: >-
  Is this the very best barbequed chicken you ever tasted? nope.... but it's
  pretty darn good! it's also about as easy as any scratch entree recipe you'll
  ever make. i prepared it a few nights back when i couldn't come up with
  anything for supper until late in the day -- that's when i remembered the
  frozen chicken (cut up) in my freezer. if the chicken is still half-frozen
  even after some defrosting in the microwave, this recipe still works fine.

 - Pre-heat your oven to 350-degrees f
 - Dump the cut up chicken parts into a large mixing bowl
 - Melt the butter in the microwave and pour it all over the chicken
 - Sprinkle the seasoning salt all over the chicken and blend the chicken parts around until they are evenly covered with the butter and seasoned salt
 - I don't bother to trim the chicken -- it really makes little difference whether you do or not
 - You can also add a little garlic powder and / or herbs if you like those flavors -- a little rosemary would be terrific
 - Prepare a roasting pan by placing a rack in the bottom which will keep the chicken off the bottom
 - Add the water to the bottom of the roasting pan
 - Lay out the chicken on the rack
 - Cover the roaster with a lid or aluminum foil and bake for one hour at 350-degrees f
 - At the end of the hour , uncover the chicken and brush on the barbeque sauce until the chicken parts are well-covered
 - Don't worry too much about the undersides
 - Re-set the oven to 250-degrees f
 - And bake the chicken for another full hour serve with side dishes
 - I like to serve the chicken with additional barbeque sauce at the table
 - My three favorite commercial sauces are kroger's hickory sauce , sweet baby ray's sauce , and open pit
