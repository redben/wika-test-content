  This is very easy, cheesy, full of flavor and a great make ahead bread loaf
  for a dinner party, bbq or just family. i love the hint of goat cheese for a
  little tang or for a little kick; but you could substitute gorgonzola or blue
  cheese; or even parmesan or romano too. there are many possibilities, but
  these are my favorite.  but a few minutes on the grill or in the oven and it's
  done.
