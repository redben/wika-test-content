description: >-
  A very good way to use leftover turkey or chicken. ci recommends using only
  whole milk yogurt (not low- or non-fat), as the sauce otherwise will be thin
  and can have an off flavor. i often have left-over roasted veggies, or will
  use a combo of sweet and white potatoes, cauliflower, squash, red onions. i
  serve this with rice or couscous, and sometimes add dried cranberries instead
  of raisins - i doubt that's indian, but it works together well. time does not
  include time to roast veggies, if you have none handy.
