 - Heat the olive oil in a pot , add the onions , and cook over a gentle flame until they are golden
 - Add the peas , and continue cooking over a gentle flame , adding a little hot water to keep them from drying out and adjusting salt and pepper to taste
 - While the peas are cooking set pasta water to boil , and when they're almost done cook the pasta
 - Drain it , stir it into the pea pot , dust with minced parsley , and turn it all out into a serving bowl , with grated cheese for those who want it
