description: "From vanilla.com   http://www.vanilla.com/index.php/recipes/desserts/banana-poe.html\r\nthe starch in poe comes from the manioc root, also known as casava and yuca. originally a food of the americas, it was taken to africa in the 16th century, and later to tropical countries worldwide. it is now a common component in pacific island cuisine. it’s filling, nutritious, and easy to digest. banana poe is so popular that it’s sold pre-mixed in boxes in the stores in tahiti.  if manioc is an unfamiliar term for you, perhaps you’re familiar with tapioca, which is also made from manioc. in poe, manioc starch is used. it can usually be found in specialty food stores, asian markets, and sometimes where bulk foods are sold."
