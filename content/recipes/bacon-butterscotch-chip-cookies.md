  After reading about 'bacon chocolate chip cookies', i thought that it sounded
  good and worth a try. found a  few recipes, but then i 'tweaked' a basic
  cookie dough recipe,  as i was out of chocolate chips. i substituted
  butterscotch chips and they turned out to be very good. as for the bacon, i
  just used a low-sodium which i had on hand. if using regular bacon, you might
  want to omit the salt in the recipe.
