  by; feel free to use them if you have them. you could even use plain white
  sugar if that's all you have. adapted from a recipe by donna currie at serious

 - Combine water , yeast , sugar and semolina flour in the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook
 - Turn on briefly to combine , then let stand 15 minutes until bubbly
 - Add bread flour and salt to bowl
 - Turn on to low and let run until dough comes together and starts to become stretchy
 - Add oil and turn up to medium or medium-high
 - Knead until satiny , shiny , and very stretchy , 8-10 minutes
 - Coat a bowl with a little olive oil
 - Form dough into a ball , and place in oiled bowl , turning to coat ball on all sides
 - Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until doubled in size , about 1 hour
 - Preheat oven to 325f scatter cornmeal over a baking sheet and set aside
 - On a lightly floured surface , knead the dough briefly , then divide in 3 equal pieces
 - Roll each piece out between your hands and the board until it forms a rope about 15" in length
 - Place the three ropes side by side
 - Beginning from the center , braid the ropes , tucking the ends under when you reach them
 - Turn the loaf around and braid the other side
 - Try not to stretch the ropes too much , or it won't fit on your pan
 - Place the loaf on the prepared baking sheet
 - You will probably have to place it diagonally
 - Squish or stretch as needed to make it fit
 - Leave at least 2" at either end to allow the loaf to grow as it proofs
 - Cover loosely with plastic and let rise until doubled in size , about 45 minutes
 - Sesame seeds are optional but traditional
 - If you wish to use them , beat egg and water and brush the bread generously , then sprinkle with sesame seeds
 - You can egg wash the bread without the sesame seeds , too , which will give it a shiny brown crust , but this is optional
 - Bake in preheated oven 45 minutes or until golden brown and an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads 200f
 - Remove from oven , transfer to a rack and cool completely before slicing
