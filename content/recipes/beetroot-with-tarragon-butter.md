description: "Love beetroot?  you will love this.\r\nsimplicity at it's best.\r\ncutting the beetroot will depend on the size of the beetroot, small beetroot in halve, large into quarters or more.  i cut it the size of a potato that is needed for potato salad.\r\nfresh dill or mint may be substituted for tarragon."
