  This is a recipe i came up with to use up leftover bbq pulled pork. it was
  such a hit with my boys that i thought i would post it. the recipe as written
  uses a loaf of rhodes bread dough as the pizza crust, but i'm sure you could
  use any crust of your choice, just follow the cooking instructions for that
  crust. i have tried this pizza on a pizza stone and on a cookie sheet, and the
  crust comes out crispier on a cookie sheet. note, the prep time assumes that
  your bread dough has already been thawed and is ready to use.
