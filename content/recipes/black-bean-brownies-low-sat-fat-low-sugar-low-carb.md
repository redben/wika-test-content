  I was given a pamphlet on recipes that use beans and the original recipe for
  these brownies was included. i switched the sugar to splenda, the eggs to egg
  substitute (or the same amount of liquid egg whites) and the vegetable oil to
  canola oil. they're just as good as a traditional brownie but you won't feel
  bad letting your kids eat them (and eat them they will)!

 - Preheat oven to 350
 - Spray an 8x8 square baking dish with cooking spray
 - Combine the black beans , egg substitute , canola oil , cocoa powder , salt , vanilla extract , splenda and instant coffee granules in a blender
 - Blend until smooth
 - Pour the mixture into the prepared dish
 - At this point , you can also sprinkle chocolate chips over the top of the mixture , if you're not watching your calories
 - Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges start to pull away from the side of the pan , about 30 minutes
 - I've also noticed that the texture gets better after being refrigerated
