 - Preheat oven to 400 degrees
 - Remove italian sausage from casing and cook in 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned , resembling ground beef
 - Drain and set aside to cool
 - Add remaining tablespoon of olive oil to large pot of boiling water and cook lasagna noodles according to package directions , except do not add salt
 - Drain well and lay out on a cutting board
 - Spray lightly with olive oil spray , flip over and spray other side
 - Cut each noodle crosswise into 2-inch squares , then cut each square in half diagonally to form "chips"
 - Arrange pasta on large baking sheets sprayed with olive oil spray
 - Combine bread crumbs , 1 / 4 cup of the parmesan , herbs , garlic powder , paprika and salt and mix well
 - Sprinkle noodles with crumb mixture , and then spray again with olive oil spray
 - Bake for 14-16 minutes , or until the edges are crisp and golden brown
 - They burn easily , so stay close !
 - Remove pans from oven and arrange chips on oven-safe plates , in one layer or piled high - your choice
 - Change oven setting to broil
 - Top with dollops of warmed ragu spicy italian style sauce , and sprinkle evenly with one and a half cups of the mozzarella , then the cooled and browned sausage , green pepper , onion and pine nuts
