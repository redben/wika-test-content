description: >-
  My version of this vegan cake has coconut oil in the cake, and coconut butter
  in the icing, but of course you can use vegetable oil in the cake, and vegan
  margarine for the icing if you prefer. the combination stipulated in the
  ingredients list, however, creates a cake and icing of such depth and
  fudginess that i never veer from it, even though i know the shopping list is a
  tiny bit demanding. but once youâ€™ve tasted it, you too must surely concur that
  a cake as good as this can be as demanding as it likes. besides, it asks
  nothing of you in the kitchen beyond some simple stirring. (recipe courtesy
  simply nigella)

 - Equipment: 8-inch round springform cake tin
 - Start with the icing , though first preheat the oven to 180c / 350f / gas mark 4 and pop in a baking sheet at the same time
 - Put all of the icing ingredients except the chopped chocolate into a heavy-based saucepan and bring to the boil , making sure everythings dissolved
 - Then turn off the heat but leave the pan on the hob then quickly add the finely chopped chocolate and swirl the pan so that it is all underwater , so to speak
 - Leave for a scant minute , then whisk until you have a darkly glossy icing , and leave to cool
 - I find this takes exactly the amount of time the cake takes to make , cook and cool
 - But do give the icing a stir with a spatula every now and again
 - Line the bottom of your springform cake tin with baking parchment
 - Put the flour , bicarb , salt and instant espresso and unsweetened cocoa in a bowl and fork to mix
 - Mix together the sugar , water , coconut oil and vinegar until the coconut oil has melted , and stir into the dry ingredients , then pour into the prepared tin and bake for 35 minutes
 - Though do check at the 30-minute mark to see if it is already done
 - When it's ready , the cake will be coming away from the edges of the tin and a cake tester will come out clean , apart from a few crumbs
 - This is a fudgy cake and you don't want to overdo it
 - Once the cake is cooked , transfer the tin to a wire rack and let the cake cool in its tin
 - Turn to your icing , and give it a good stir with a spatula to check it is at the right consistency
 - It needs to be runny enough to cover the cake , but thick enough to stay on the top
 - So pour over the unmoulded cake , and use a spatula to ease the icing to the edges , if needed
 - If you wish to decorate , now is the time to do it
 - In which case , sprinkle joyously with rose petals and chopped pistachios or anything else that your heart desires
 - Otherwise , leave it gleaming darkly and , indeed , sumptuously
 - Leave to stand for 30 minutes for the icing to set before slicing into the cake
 - Freeze
 - When cool , carefully wrap cake in a double layer of clingfilm and a layer of foil
 - Freeze for up to 3 months
 - To defrost , unwrap and place on a serving plate at room temperature for 34 hours
