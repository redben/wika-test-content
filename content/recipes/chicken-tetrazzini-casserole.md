  I picked up a copy of southern living's comfort foods recipe magazine at the
  grocery store.  i decided to try their chicken tetrazzini.  i haven't had this
  since i was a kid and forgot all about it!   this recipe makes 2 casseroles. 
  one to prepare immediately and one to freeze for later!  after serving to my
  family i asked the big question...."should i make this again sometime?"  i
  received two overwhelming yes's from my kids, and one "yeah, ok" from my
  husband.  i'd say that this recipe is a keeper!  i served it with fresh bakery
  bread.
