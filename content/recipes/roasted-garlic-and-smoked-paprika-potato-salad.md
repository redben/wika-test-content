description: >-
  This recipe was inspired by and created with the secret ingredients for the
  rsc #15 contest.  qualifying ingredients were roasted garlic, smoked paprika,
  spicy brown mustard, thyme and eggs.  my family absolutely loved it and were
  actually horrified to find that i didn't submit this one. :)  for roasting
  garlic please see my recipe #412117.  this is also great with some cooked and
  crumbled bacon added in.
