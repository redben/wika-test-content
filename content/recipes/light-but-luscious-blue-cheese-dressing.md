  This is truly luscious, no other way to describe it.  i hope you agree.  fresh
  blue cheese dressing that is light is a real treat.  the dried powdered milk,
  might seem like a fiddly ingredient, but it makes a big impact in the
  creaminess, comes in a small box and lasts about a year, so it won't go to
  waste.  plus, you can throw it any creamy soup or mashed potatoes too.  you
  can also use minced garlic instead of roasted, but roasted gives it one more
  element of lusciousness!  cooking time is actually "flavor melding time".
