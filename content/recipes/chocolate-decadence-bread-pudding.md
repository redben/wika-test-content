  I got this recipe from a  spice island recipe card that was tucked in a womans
  magazine years ago.  i have been making it for years and have always got rave
  reviews. old fashioned white bread works best but you can use any type of
  white bread. i can't find it on thier website anymore so i want to post it for
  safe keeping.
