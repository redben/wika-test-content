description: >-
  This is the easiest way to cook an authentic mexican barbacoa instead of
  cooking it in the traditional way in mexico with the head wrapped in large
  banana leaves and three layers of burlap and then placed in a deep hole in the
  ground, just like the hawaiian pork luau.

 - Rinse the cheeks and place them in a good size crock pot , discarding any chunks that are just fat
 - Add garlic cloves , onion , bay leaves , oregano , black pepper , salt , and squeeze the orange juice from the two oranges over the meat
 - Set the crock pot on high and cook for two hours , then stir the contents with a big spoon
 - Stir every hour after that
 - In six hours it should be starting to fall apart
 - Cook for an extra hour if needed and then remove from the crock pot to a large bowl with a slotted spoon , draining the meat from juices and removing the bay leaves and all the fat
 - Shred the meat with two forks and serve on tacos with the tortillas and the extras
 - The best is to place some meat on a warm tortilla , top with cilantro , squirt on some lime juice and hot salsa , sauce or chopped jalapeo , roll up and enjoy with some charro beans as a side
 - Mmmmmm -- it is so good
