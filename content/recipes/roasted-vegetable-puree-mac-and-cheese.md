description: "This variation of mac and cheese is chock full of vegetables, they actually make the sauce. it is definitely healthier than most mac and cheese and to me tastes just as nice. you can try any vegetable puree that you like, but my favourite is kohlrabi, so ive listed that in the ingredients.\r\ni got the idea for this from the chowvida blog: http://chowvida.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/macinsquash/"
