  Chef rob pronk at hopkins hotel in belize as printed in the cookbook 'flavors
  of belize'. please use a good quality aged balsamic. i tested this sauce over
  steamed summer vegetables: zucchini, cauliflower and broccoli;  leftover brown
  rice. unusual yet delicious combination of flavors. recipe introduction in the
  cookbook recommends the sauce over beef tenderloin or fish.
