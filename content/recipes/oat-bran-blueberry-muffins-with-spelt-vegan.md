description: >-
  "veganized" (?) from the recipe on the package of oat bran.  this also uses
  spelt flour instead of regular wheat, of course you could use regular flour
  instead.  i was pleasantly surprised at how well these turned out - really
  light, maybe a little crumbly due to the spelt.  in a nutshell, really good
  and all the benefits of the oat bran!
