description: "This recipe is from week one of my food blog, \"travel by stove.\" i am attempting to cook one meal from every country in the world, starting with abkhazia (a very small country near georgia).\r\n\r\nadjika is a kind of condiment popular in several countries in that part of the world. i had a hard time finding an actual recipe for abkhazian adjika, so here is my best guess, based on a few vague references i found online.\r\n\r\nadjika can be used to flavor chicken or other dishes, or you could be creative and spread it on bread or sandwiches."
