 - Preheat oven to 350 degrees f
 - Mix the three cans of soup with 2 cups of milk and the stick of butter in a saucepan
 - Place the saucepan over low heat as you work on the chicken , being sure to stir the soup mixture occasionally
 - Remove any extra fat , skin , and gristle from the chicken and discard it
 - Cut the uncooked chicken breast meat into bite-sized chunks
 - When the soup mixture is hot and smooth , start assembling your casserole
 - Use a large oven proof casserole dish , about 14" x 10" x2"
 - If you don't have a dish this large , make two small casseroles and cook for a shorter time
 - Spray baking dish with cooking spray , if desired
 - This is not a necessary step , however , though it might make serving a little easier
 - Pour 1 / 2 of soup mixture into bottom of baking dish
 - Lightly and evenly sprinkle the long grain and wild rice over the top of the soup mixture
 - Reserve the seasoning pack for another use
 - Next , place the chunks of uncooked chicken evenly over the top of the rice
 - Now pour the remaining soup mixture over the top of the chicken chunks
 - Finish off the casserole by generously sprinkling the top with grated parmesan cheese
 - You may grate fresh parmesan cheese or use kraft's
 - It is important that you sprinkle plenty of the parmesan cheese
 - Betty uses 1 / 2 of the large kraft can
 - Cover the casserole with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour
 - Remove the foil and brown the top for about 15 minutes
 - If you bake the casserole uncovered for 1 hour 15 minutes , it won't be quite as saucy
 - Serve while hot
