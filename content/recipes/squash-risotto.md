 - Boil the squash in a pot
 - You can also steam it
 - Heat the water in a pot and maintain it just below a boil
 - Warm a third pot to medium and add the oil and onion
 - Coat the onion in oil and cook it until it is translucent , but not browned
 - If using dried thyme , add it now
 - Otherwise , the fresh thyme can wait until the very end of this whole process
 - Add the rice and stir to coat it in the oil
 - Pour in the wine and stir until it is all absorbed
 - Add 2 tsp sea salt
 - Add the heated water to the rice cup at a time , stirring constantly until all the liquid is absorbed before adding more
 - Use all 3 cups of water for a very creamy risotto , or only 2-2 cups for a sticky risotto
 - When all the liquid is absorbed , the rice should be soft , but only just cooked
 - Then you can stir in the squash
 - Garnish your squash risotto recipe with cracked black pepper and optionally roasted pumpkin seeds for the best meal ever
