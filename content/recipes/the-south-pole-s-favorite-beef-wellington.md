 - Trim all the fat and silver skin off the tenderloin , then rub it all over with salt and pepper
 - Add about half of the butter to a pan and melt it over medium heat
 - Let it foam , then add the tenderloin and sear it on all sides until it is a nice brown color
 - Remove the meat from the pan and let it cool
 - Now in the same skillet , add the rest of the butter and melt over high heat
 - Add the mushrooms and saut until they reduce in size , but don't let them brown
 - Just before the mushrooms are done , add the garlic
 - Pour in the wine and cook over a medium high heat until the liquid is reduced and the mixture is almost dry
 - Add the thyme , salt and pepper
 - Remove the mushrooms from the heat and let them cool in a shallow pan
 - Then put them in a food processor and chop them until they form a rough paste
 - Set aside
 - Lay the puff pastry out on the work surface
 - You may have to use some flour to prevent sticking
 - Now spread the mushroom mixture in a wide strip down the center of the pastry , leaving about an inch and a half of bare pastry at each end
 - Slice the pat thinly and lay the slices down the center of the mushroom strip
 - Brush the tenderloin all over with dijon mustard
 - As gently as you can , place the tenderloin in the middle of the mushroom and pat strip and wrap the pastry over it
 - Seal the edges with your fingers , then brush with the egg and water mixture to ensure a good seal
 - Repeat with the ends
 - Now turn the wrapped meat over and place it in a greased pan so the seam is at the bottom
 - Brush the egg mixture over all the pastry , and then make three slits in the top to stop the pastry from bursting open while cooking
 - Bake at 400 degrees until the internal temperature reaches 120 degrees
 - So if you want a rare or medium rare beef make sure to take it out early
 - Use a meat thermometer that can stay in the oven while cooking to ensure perfect results
 - The pastry should be a golden color when you take it out of the oven
 - Let it rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing
 - When you do cut into it , the juices should flow out and you can use this to make an au jus sauce to serve with it
