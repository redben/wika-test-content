 - First you will need a sauce pan that has a steamer basket
 - If your lobster tails are frozen thaw them out
 - Cut the top of the lobster tail enough to allow expansion of the meat
 - In the sauce pan - on a medium low heat mix together the garlic , butter and white wine stirring occasionally
 - Once the butter wine mix comes to a boil , place the steam basket and cover
 - Let the lobster tails steam for 8 minutes
 - They will turn bright red
 - Set aside
 - Using a strainer , pour the butter wine mixture into serving cups
 - Use the butter wine mixture to dip the lobster tails inches i hope you enjoy it !
