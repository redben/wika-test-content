title: Sarasota S Minnesota Turkey Mushroom And Wild Rice Soup
date: 2010-03-06T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  This was a classic growing up. a little creamy, all fresh ingredients,
  mushrooms from a local farmer, and wild rice from a friend who was from mn,
  but rented one of our cottages every summer and always brought tons of mn wild
  rice. now if you don't have turkey leftovers (which i almost always do), use
  chicken which will work just fine. but there is something about the turkey
  that is just perfect with this. if i don't have leftover turkey, i often buy a
  small turkey breast just so i can make this soup, and use the rest for
  sandwiches. and no turkey stock?  ... chicken stock or broth is fine. just
  don't skimp on a few things. 1) sherry wine, 2) real wild rice, 3) fresh
  vegetables and, mushrooms, and; 4) fresh herbs. it just isn't the same
  otherwise. i can have just a bowl of this for dinner or it makes a great
  starter, or wonderful with just a salad or grilled sandwich.

 - Soup base -- in a large pot , melt the butter and add the leeks , onions , celery , fennel and garlic and cook on medium heat until slightly translucent and soft
 - About 5 minutes
 - Rice -- add the rice right to the vegetable mixture and stir until well combined - then add the broth , thyme , rosemary , worcestershire and bay leaf
 - Cover and cook on low heat approximately 30 minutes until the rice is somewhat tender
 - Once again , taste for seasoning and add more broth if necessary
 - It depends on how thin or thick you like your soup
 - The soup still has a bit more time to cook which will allow the rice to finish cooking
 - Mushrooms -- at this point , add the sherry wine and mushrooms and continue to cook another 15-20 minutes until the rice is tender and the mushrooms are soft
 - Finish -- everything is done - now to finish off the soup
 - First , add in the turkey or chicken
 - And add the heavy cream to the soup
 - Increase the heat to medium and bring to a light boil and then reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes
 - Stir and add in any additional seasoning if necessary and the fresh parsley
 - Serve -- my favorite way to serve this is with a toasted baguette with melted gruyere cheese
 - Now , if you happen to have truffle oil -- drizzle a little on top , it is heaven
 - Can't get much better than that ! enjoy !
