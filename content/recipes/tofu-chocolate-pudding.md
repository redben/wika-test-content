description: "I personally think that the mori nu silken (firm) tofu  works beautifully for this recipe. its vegan and gluten free and is a real treat for those wanting vegan desserts. for an intense chocolate flavour you can increase the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup but 2/3 cup works best for us.\r\n\r\nyou can see more step wise photos in this link - http://chefinyou.com/2011/03/tofu-chocolate-pudding/"
