  Another recipe that i've adapted from justbento.com.  any ready to eat sausage
  will work in this, and i think bacon would be good as well. the peas could
  also be replaced with corn, sauteed mushrooms, or whatever else sounds good to
  you.

 - Saut the onion , garlic and sausage in the olive oil over medium-high heat , until onions are limp and the sausage has rendered its fat and is turning a bit crispy
 - Add the well drained quinoa and saut briefly until it is lightly browned
 - Add the mustard seeds and saut for a minute or two , to bring out the flavor
 - Add the broth and bring to a boil
 - Lower the heat , add the salt , pepper , herbs de provence , and put on a lid
 - Let it cook for 10 to 12 minutes , until the water has been completely absorbed and the quinoa is no longer hard
 - Add the fresh herbs and green peas
 - Taste , and adjust the seasoning if needed
 - I occasionally find that the quinoa is tender before all the liquid is absorbed
 - I just drain off the excess
 - Serve warm or cold
 - This will keep in the refrigerator , well covered , for 2 to 3 days
