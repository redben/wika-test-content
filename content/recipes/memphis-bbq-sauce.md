  This bbq sauce is super easy and totally awesome! you can use it immediately
  but it does get better when it sits. this sauce is gooey, spicy and sweet.  if
  you do not like hot/spicy foods simply adjust or omit the pepper sauce and
  pepper flakes.  i add some pan drippings/marinade that i strained and removed
  the fat but the sauce is still delicious with out it.
