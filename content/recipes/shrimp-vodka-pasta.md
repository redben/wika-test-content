  Easy, peasy recipe i got from cooking light.  it had got a lot of positive
  reviews,plus i had all the ingredients on hand, so i thought to try it!  dh
  really (really) enjoyed this dish.  i loved this particular dish because it
  used up a lot of "its and bits" i had floating around.  i made it with
  pre-made marinara sauce... had the shrimp in the freezer needing to be used
  up...whipping cream on hand, and 2 little tester bottles of vodka that had
  been sitting in the cupboard for ever!!!.  i had just had surgery on my knee,
  so this meal was real easy for me to prepare, while not skimping on results! 
  you have got to love those type of meals!!!
