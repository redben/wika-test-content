description: >-
  Original recipe calls for a 3 oz bottle of bacon bits rather than fresh-cooked
  bacon.  this is what i have been looking for; i love quiche, but most have
  spinach or asparagus and dh does not like that part...  *note:  it may look
  like the egg mixture will not fit in the crust after the cheese is added; i
  took out about 1/2 a cup of cheese, poured the egg in and then sprinkled the
  remaining cheese on top using a fork to mash the cheese down into the egg
  mixture.  filled the crust perfectly and it did not overflow.*
