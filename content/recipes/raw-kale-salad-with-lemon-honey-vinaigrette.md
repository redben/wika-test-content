 - Combine the four salad ingredients in a large bowl
 - Whisk together the vinaigrette ingredients and toss with the salad
 - I like to massage the kale and dressing at this point
 - Just massage it with both hands for a few minutes
 - Toss in any additional fruits or berries
 - Refrigerate for at least one hour prior to serving to allow the flavors to develop
 - Serve and enjoy !
 - This is even better the next day and hold up well w / o wilting
 - Try adding mango , watermelon or blueberries to the mix !
