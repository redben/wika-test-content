  Many people think you can't use words like thick, rich and creamy to describe
  vegan food. this is a vegan chowder recipe that proves you wrong. seriously.
  after a week of bronchitis and rainy cold weather, i decided it was time for a
  chowder. this is really rich, super tasty, filling and actually pretty easy to
  make. i like to eat it with some nice fluffy french bread, but you could aslo
  serve it with biscuits or even in a breadbowl.
