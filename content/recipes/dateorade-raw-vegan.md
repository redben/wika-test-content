description: "(lfrv compliant!)  popular high-carb high-calorie get you moving drink loved by many low fat raw vegans aka frugivores!  struggling to get your calories in?  this is the key & tastes amazing!!  the amount of water is up to you - less for more of a pudding and extra for more of a milky drink.  play with the ratios to find what you prefer!!  popularized by freelee at 30bananasaday.com.  \r\n\r\nsoft, succulent, organic medjool dates are best but any will do.  soak your dates for 6 hours or overnight.  if you can't get organic then discard the soaking water or drain & rinse about half way through the soak time and keep the second round of soak water.  (times don't include soaking).\r\n\r\nremember food combining!!  this will move fast through your system so nothing heavier before and wait an hour after sweet fruit for a different type."
