  My sister-in-law joann made this for family picnics quite often.  i had never
  had macaroni salad with tuna before, and it's become one of my favorite summer
  lunches to keep on hand during hot weather.  the more fresh vegetables you
  use, the better!  add another can of tuna if you like a little more protein.
