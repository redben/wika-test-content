  This recipe is from autralian good food june 2010 easy one-pot family meals
  bonus book. my dad made this for me and the chicken was so tender and tasty.
  the sauce is delicious and hearty with its italian flavours, it makes a great
  winter meal. i would not recommend leaving out the anchovies if you don't like
  them. i don't like them, but i didn't know they were in there until dad told
  me! i think they are important to the flavour of the sauce, as are the capers
  and rosemary. if you don't have fresh rosemary, dried works just fine. you
  could also use chicken breast instead of thigh fillets, i don't usually like
  thigh fillets, but in this dish i thought they were delicious, very tender and
  almost falling apart. you would probably not get quite the same result with
  breast. if you do use breast you will have to reduce the cooking time. also,
  make sure you use a pan with a lid, because it needs to be covered during part
  of the cooking process. it is great served with salad greens and crusty bread.
