  When i made this pizza crust for the first time, my so thought i was trying to
  gluten him. (i wasn't, of course!) it's definitely the best gluten free crust
  i've every had! i adapted the recipe from
  http://www.glutenfreecookingschool.com/archives/gluten-free-pizza/. the
  ingredients are basically the same, but i added a few steps to allow the pizza
  to rise. prep time includes rising time.

 - Heat the milk in the microwave until it is just warm to the touch
 - Add 1 tsp of sugar and the yeast
 - Stir and set aside
 - In a large bowl , combine the rice flour , cornstarch , xanthan gum , salt , rosemary , garlic powder , oregano , and 2 tsp of sugar
 - The yeast mixture should have some bubbles at the top
 - If it doesn't , throw it out and remix
 - If it does have bubbles , add the olive oil and cider vinegar
 - Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture and stir to combine
 - Prepare your pan by greasing it and sprinkling it with rice flour
 - Pour out your dough and add enough rice flour so that it is workable
 - Starting in the center , work the dough out to the sides of the pan using your fingers
 - Once your crust is spread out , lightly coat it with olive oil to prevent drying and let it rise in a warm area for 40-60 minutes
 - Preheat your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit
 - Cook the crust without toppings for 8 minutes
 - Remove the crust and top it as you wish
 - Return the pizza to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the cheese is nice and melty
 - Then , i can slide the parchment paper off and let the crust rise while i stick the pizza stone in the oven to preheat
 - The crust gets a great texture this way
 - I've never made this recipe on a regular pizza pan , so i look forward to reading your reviews
