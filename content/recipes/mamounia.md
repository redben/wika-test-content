  Syrian semolina pudding. i am intrigued by the use of semolina for dessert
  (see recipe #456067 for example) and until fairly recently have only used it
  for bread baking. i found this recipe in the cookbook 'recipes for an arabian
  night' by david scott. good for breakfast or dessert!

 - Melt the butter in a heavy pan
 - Lightly brown the semolina on low heat for 5 minutes
 - Meanwhile , combine the sugar , water and milk in another pan and bring almost to a boil
 - Once the semolina is done , gently stir in the sugar / milk mixture
 - Use a whisk to break up any lumps
 - Cook to desired consistency
 - For me , this step only took about 2 minutes
 - If the mixture is too thick , add a little bit of milk or water
 - Stir in the rosewater
 - Spoon the semolina pudding into individual dessert cups and set aside to cool slightly
 - Cover and chill
 - Just before serving , sprinkle the top of the pudding with ground cinnamon and garnish with the sliced almonds
