description: "This is soo good! i had about a pound of meat leftover from a really nice chuck roast. so, i shredded it and chopped it and the rest is just the easiest and most delicious meat for whatever you want it to be! sometimes i make taco meat with taco bell dry seasoning and hamburger. i just happened to have some leftover chuck roast, so decided to use it instead of the hamburger. it's very, very good and a little something different. amounts are questimated.\r\nyou can make tacos or burritos, soft tacos or even put the filling on a bun and add cheese. these are just a few of the ways you can use this meat filling."
