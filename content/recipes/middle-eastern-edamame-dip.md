 - Cook edamame according to package directions but omit the salt
 - I lightly boiled the edamame and [reserved] some of the cooking liquid
 - Place the olive oil , salt , cumin and garlic in a food processor
 - Pulse 2-3 times
 - Add the edamame and the remaining ingredients
 - Blend to desired consistency
 - If the mixture is too thick you can thin it with a little bit of the edamame cooking liquid
 - Taste and adjust with more salt or lemon if needed
 - We served the edamame dip with a light drizzle of olive oil on top followed by a sprinkle of sumac , a sprig of fresh parsley and accompanied by recipe #100777
