  Found online and posted for zwt 7, south pacific. the author claims this is of
  japanese origin but has become a very popular polynesian dish. prep time
  includes marinating time. this says it makes 24 skewers, but i have difficulty
  believing that one pound of meat can go that far! therefore, the number of
  servings here is a guess.
