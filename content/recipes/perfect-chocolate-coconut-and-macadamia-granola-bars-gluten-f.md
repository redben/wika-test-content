 - Preheat oven to 350
 - Line a 9 x 13 inch pan with parchment paper
 - Beat sugar and shortening until well blended
 - Add honey , egg replacer , water , and vanilla and beat until smooth
 - Mix flour , xantham gum , salt , and baking soda in a small mixing bowl
 - Add the dry ingredients to the wet and beat until well blended
 - Scape down the sides to make sure everything was blended evenly
 - Add the remaining ingredients and fold together with a spatula
 - Really work the mixture around to make sure everything is blended evenly
 - Use spatula to spread the mixture evenly in the parchment lined pan
 - Use another sheet of parchment and press down very firmly
 - You should have a nice even pan of dough
 - Use your finger
 - You want to eliminate any air pockets in the dough
 - Bake for 20 minutes or until the bars are a medium to dark honey brown color
 - While hot , get the same piece of parchment used before and lay on top of bars , place a tea towel or clean kitchen towel over the pachment and press down again
 - Don't forget the edges
 - When the bars have cooled down reasonably , remove them by lifting up on the parchment paper
 - For nice even bars , start on the 9 inch side and cut in half and then in half again so you have 4 even rows in front of you
 - Then flip the slab to the 13 inch side and cut in thirds going across
 - This will give you nice even sort of commercial looking bars
 - Wrap individually in plastic wrap once they are completely cool
 - Update: i have made these again with some new healthier options
 - Decrease sugar to 1 / 3 cup
 - Decrease shortening to 1 / 4 cup and add 1 / 4 cup apple sauce
 - Replace 1 / 4 cup rice flour with 1 / 4 cup millet flour or teff
 - Add 2 tbsp chia seed
 - Bake an additional 5 minutes:)
