description: "My first attempt at brown rice in pampered chef's rice cooker was crunchy, so i added more water and got good rice.\r\n\r\nthe rice i had did not have microwave instructions, and i didn't want to start buying a different brand and that is why i am adding this so i can look up how i got it to work.\r\n\r\nif you make your own stock you can probably use that in place of the water, and leave the stock cubes out. i just used what i had on hand."
