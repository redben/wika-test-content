 - Pour coffee into an ice cube tray and freeze
 - You will not need all the coffee cubes but they can be saved in a baggie to make this wonderful drink again
 - Place the 1 / 2 cup milk , cocoa mix , coffee beans and ice cream in blender container
 - Add in 2 to 3 frozen coffee cubes and blend until smooth
 - The number of ice cubes depends on how much coffee flavor and how thick you want your shake
 - If you are using the tia maria add it prior to blending
 - If the shake is to thick add in the remaining milk until desired consistency
 - Pour into 2 glasses , garnish with whipped cream , drizzle with chocolate syrup
 - Sprinkle with chopped coffee beans and enjoy
