 - Brush a small amount of corn syrup on the top of a gold or red-foil peanut butter cup
 - Place an inverted green-foil peanut butter cup on top of the first one
 - The bottom peanut butter cup is the pot / planter and the top peanut butter cup is the bottom / base the tree
 - Brush some corn syrup on top of the tree base
 - Top with a green-foil hershey kiss
 - Brush corn syrup on the tree and sprinkle non-pareils over the tree
 - You could use a spray glue or hot glue instead of corn syrup , but i use corn syrup just in case it gets into someone's mouth when the tree is unwrapped and eaten
