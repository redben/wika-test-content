 - Season the chicken with salt and pepper and let rest
 - In a small skillet , saute onions in the butter until they are golden brown
 - In a larger skillet with tall sides , heat olive oil and brown the chicken on both sides , but do not cook through
 - Remove chicken from the pan and set aside
 - While the pan is still hot , deglaze with the chicken broth , and use a whisk or spatula to loosen all the browned bits
 - Add the heavy cream and the balsamic vinegar to the chicken broth
 - Add salt and pepper to taste and red pepper flakes whisk through
 - Add the mushrooms to the cream sauce and simmer for 10 minutes
 - Add onions into the sauce
 - Place the chicken back into the pan with the sauces , increase heat to medium and saute until chicken is fully cooked and juices run clear
 - Remove chicken and add the parmesan cheese to the sauce
 - Stir until melted through the sauce
 - Plate the chicken , top with sauce , and garnish with fresh parsley
 - I often serve this chicken over the top of basmati rice
