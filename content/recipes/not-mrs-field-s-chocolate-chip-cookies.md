  Apparently there's a story behind the title: some lady accidentally paid a lot
  of money for the recipe (they said $375, she heard $3.75...or somesuch) and
  they wouldn't let her return it when she discovered the true cost. so she got
  her money's worth and published it in the local newspaper with this title. 
  this recipe has been modified by my mother and i to make it a little less
  greasy. people who have tried my recipe always comment that they usually don't
  like oatmeal cookies, but they love these!

 - Mix together oil , sugars and egg
 - Add in baking soda , powder , and vanilla
 - Slowly add flour and mix until consistent
 - Add oatmeal and chocolate chips
 - Preheat oven to 375 degrees f
 - On a greased or non-stick baking pan , make about 1-1 / 2 inch size drops of dough spaced 2 inches apart
 - Bake for 10 minutes
 - In my experience , baking them even a minute longer results in hard cookies once they have cooled
