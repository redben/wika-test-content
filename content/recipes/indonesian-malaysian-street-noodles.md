  My boyfriend from south east asia said this is closer to traditional than most
  of the yellow curry versions we see in the us. no meat in this one but i'm
  sure you could add! feel free to mix up the veggies too. the first time i made
  this, i used broccoli, snap peas, and baby corn instead. although, the peppers
  are traditional. adapted from pinch of yum
