description: >-
  Based on a recipe from robin robertson’s book, vegan planet. the intro to this
  recipe says, “serve this delicious and extremely versatile sauce with steamed
  vegetables or spring rolls, or toss with hot or cold cooked noodles.” for a
  natural sweetener i use agave nectar although any other natural sweetener is
  fine if not using refined sugar. my husband and i are always in need of a
  peanut dipping sauce for his awesome homemade rice paper spring rolls. i
  haven’t yet found a store-bought sauce that i’d buy again.
