  I found the original recipe on another site with half the spices and reviewers
  said it was too bland so i'm posting it here to try myself with a little more
  punch.  i also want to try mixing some coconut milk into the batter and frying
  in peanut oil.  if it's worth posting i'll add it but if someone else has an
  opinion there first i'd love to hear it.  :)
