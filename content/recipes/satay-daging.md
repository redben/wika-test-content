 - Cut beef into small cubes , about 2 cm
 - Thick each way
 - Trim off excess fat , leaving a thin layer of fat on some of the cubes
 - Cut the trimmed-off fat into thin squares
 - Combine turmeric , cumin , fennel , lemon rind , salt , sugar and coconut milk in a bowl and stir to dissolve sugar
 - Add beef and mix well , cover and leave to marinate for 1 hour or longer
 - The longer it is left , the more the flavors will penetrate the meat
 - Thread on bamboo skewers that have been soaked in cold water for a few hours , putting about 5 pieces on the end of each skewer and leaving at least half the skewer uncovered
 - Use the squares of fat where necessary , for they keep the meat tender
 - Grill over hot coals or under a preheated griller until beef is well done and crisp and brown on all sides
 - Serve immediately
