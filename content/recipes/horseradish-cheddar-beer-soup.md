title: Horseradish Cheddar Beer Soup
date: 2010-01-03T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  This hearty soup is adapted from a recipe by jenny levison, owner of souper
  jenny, a buckhead ga cafe that serves hundreds of bowls of soup a day from a
  menu that changes daily. jenny's soup-making tips include "tasting everything
  as you go, using recipes as a guide. read through them and substitute if you
  need to adapt to what you have on hand or your taste, and then try it!" she
  suggests using a dark beer like guinness; others prefer pale ale ... but use a
  lighter beer if you'd like. i especially like the combination of horseradish,
  cheese and beer in the basic recipe and suggest adding spices, etc., to
  heighten flavors as desired. i've included optional additions that might give
  you some ideas but are not part of the original recipe. another golden whisk
  winner as one of "the best recipes of 2009" awarded by the atlanta journal
  constitution.
