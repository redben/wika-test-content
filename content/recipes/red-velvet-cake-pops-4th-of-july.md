description: >-
  Start this project at least the day before you need them, and set aside at
  least a few hours for rolling and dipping.  you will need a package of 50
  paper sucker sticks and a styrofoam block. if you need to add more melted
  candy to your bowl, do not put un-melted candy in with the melted candy and
  re-heat it, it will overcook the candy.  rather, melt the new candy and then
  pour it into the already melted candy.
