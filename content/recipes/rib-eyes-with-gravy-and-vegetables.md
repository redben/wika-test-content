 - If you like you can brown your steaks but i normally don't do that
 - Mix onion soup and beef gravy
 - In a dutch oven put steaks and top with gravy mixture
 - Add pepper to taste
 - Cook steaks for about two hours
 - I cook with a lid on
 - When the steaks are done , take them out of the gravy mixture and put the diced potatoes and carrots in the gravy
 - Cook until vegetables are done , about ten minutes
