 - Place the rice in a medium-sized bowl
 - Fill the bowl with cold water and swirl the rice around to help remove the starch
 - Carefully pour off the water , making sure not to pour out the rice that has settled to the bottom
 - Repeat this step 7-8 times , or until the water is clear
 - Fill the bowl with enough cold water to cover the rice by 2 inches
 - Let the rice soak for 30 minutes
 - Drain the rice and set aside
 - Place the milk in a 6-8- quart pan over medium heat , uncovered , and bring to a boil
 - This will take about 10-12 minutes
 - Watch it carefully so it does not boil over , and stir frequently to prevent scorching
 - Add the drained rice
 - Return it to a boil
 - This will take 1-2 minutes
 - Reduce to a simmer and cook , uncovered , for 30-35 minutes
 - The rice will absorb the milk as it cooks and thickens
 - Stir frequently , occasionally mashing the rice with a whisk
 - If the rice sticks , lower the heat
 - After almost all the milk has been absorbed and the rice is very tender , add the sugar and ground cardamom
 - Stir well to combine all the ingredients
 - Pour the rice into a heat-proof bowl
 - Let it cool for 10-15 minutes
 - Cover and chill completely
 - When ready to serve , spoon the chilled dessert into individual serving dishes and garnish with the pistachios , raisins , and sliced almonds
