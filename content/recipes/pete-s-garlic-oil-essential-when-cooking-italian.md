 - Remove rough end of garlic cloves and slice each in half lengthwise
 - Do not remove skin , they contribute favor and removed later
 - Place them in a narrow stainless steel butter melting pot
 - Add the rest of the ingredients
 - If the olive oil doesn't cover the garlic , add more
 - Place on medium heat until the olive oil begins to lightly sizzle
 - Reduce heat to a low simmer
 - It will take several hours before garlic richly tans and becomes soft and sweet
 - You can hasten the process with slightly higher heat but be careful not to burn the garlic
 - Remove the garlic skins from the pot when they are released from the cloves
 - Substitute pete's garlic oil and pan roasted garlic when ever plain olive oil and garlic is required
