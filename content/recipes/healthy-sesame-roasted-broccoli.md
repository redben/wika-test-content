description: "I have yet to find a roasted veggie that i didn't like, so i am constantly playing with healthy, low calorie sauces and seasonings for them.  i came up with this last night to accompany linmarie's recipe #45809 and sue lau's recipe #38748.  i think it would be just as good with green beans (though the cooking time would need to be decreased slightly).  also, if you prefer a sweeter sauce, you could add a tablespoon of honey or brown sugar, as it is a fairly salty sauce as written.  if you want to reduce the fat and calories, you can omit the olive oil and simply spray the broccoli with cooking spray before roasting.\r\n\r\nnote: i love raw garlic flavor myself, but if 4 cloves seems like more raw garlic than you would like, trying stirring the garlic and ginger in with the broccoli before roasting as susie d brilliantly suggested!  :)"
