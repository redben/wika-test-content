  For zwt6 tour: greek region.  in greek this is called souvlaki mosharisio.  i
  think the marinade is going to prove very flavorful but still allow the beef
  to shine.  beef kebabs are not as traditional as kebabs with chicken, pork, or
  lamb, but they are delicious. the key to this recipe is to start with tender
  shank meat.  they do not have it listed but i think some button mushrooms
  threaded on the skewers would be great with this recipe too.
