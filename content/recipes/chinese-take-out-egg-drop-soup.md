  I've found it easier (and cheaper) to make chinese food at home. no more
  waiting for the delivery driver to bring you cold food, no more waiting to be
  served in a restaurant, no more tipping. this is one of many chinese recipes
  that i prepare, and we feast at home for a fraction of the price. the best
  part is, we know it is going to be good. i hope you enjoy this one of my many
  "stay at home" chinese dishes.
