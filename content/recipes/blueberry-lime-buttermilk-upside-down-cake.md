  I came up with this cake to use up little bits of things i had laying around: 
  blueberries, white chocolate, buttermilk and limes.  and i gotta say, i love
  this cake.  a hint of buttermilk and white chocolate in the light cake with a
  crispy crusty "bottom", enriched with an sweet and sticky brown
  sugar-blueberry-lime "top." if you are not a huge fan of very sweet desserts,
  you may want to reduce the brown sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup or so.  it is
  phenomenal served with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream!
