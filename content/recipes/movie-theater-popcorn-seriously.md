description: "Taking reviewers suggestions, i've modified the salt content to 1 teaspoon, thank you for the feedback.\r\n\r\nwhen i was a young man, i worked at a theater.  one of the main differences in the way that theaters pop their corn is the addition of finely ground salt into the pot while it is popping. well, that and that the oil is tinted yellow with coloring.  you can add as little or as much salt as you like, these are just my preferences.  this recipe is done on the cooktop."
