  A favorite quick and easy breakfast dish. the intoxicating smell of baking
  cinnamon rolls and roasting apples will have you standing around the oven
  drooling as you peek through the oven window. this recipe originally started
  from the pampered chef recipe “apple nut ring”, but over the years  was 
  evolved into a wonderfully  amazing breakfast oozing with sweet frosting,
  plump raisins, pecans, and roasted apples. these are phenomenal served warm
  with a large glass of milk. adapted from sweet peas kitchen and she barely
  adapted it from pampered chef. enjoy!
