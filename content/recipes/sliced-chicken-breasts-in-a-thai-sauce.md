description: >-
  Easy and quick, and also fresh and healthy! in this house each diner will get
  2 chicken breasts, so the recipe serves 3 people -- but if you have smallies
  also sharing, 1 breast each will be enough for them, so my "3 - 6 portions"
  take that into account.

 - Flatten the breasts gently with a meat mallet
 - Dredge lightly in the flour , and cut into strips
 - Heat a good layer of oil in a pan
 - Fry the strips , stirring , until done
 - Use quite a high heat: they will cook quickly
 - Drain on kitchen paper , and keep warm
 - Fry the sweet pepper strips in the same pan , stirring
 - You might have to add more oil
 - Fry briefly , so that they are still crisp
 - Then add the ginger , garlic and spring onion , and stir through for a minute or so
 - Remove from heat , and stir in the thai sweet chilli sauce
 - Put the chicken strips in a serving bowl , and spoon over the peppers and sauce
 - Nice-looking if served on top of a mound of jasmine rice , or -- healthier -- brown basmati
 - Nice sides are al dente thin baby green beans and a crisp salad
