title: Moroccan Salad My Way

  This is my take on a moroccan salad from a local restaurant.  the listed
  measurements are all approximate because the zaar computer must have amounts
  listed - so use the amounts you desire of each ingredient.  i used raspberry
  vinaigrette for the dressing, the original salad uses champagne vinaigrette
  and includes roasted butternut squash (in place of the sweet potato, however,
  i loved the sweetness of the potato in the salad), chopped egg, red peppers
  and avocado.  i went with what i had on hand.  my niece suggested using
  mandarin oranges and feta.  just let your imagination go wild and enjoy!

 - Chop lettuce very fine
 - Cut beets into bite-size pieces
 - Cut dates into bite-size pieces
 - Cut sweet potato into bite size pieces
 - Combine the lettuce , beets , dates and nuts and toss with desired dressing
 - Because the sweet potato are soft add them last and 'gently' toss again
 - Enjoy !
