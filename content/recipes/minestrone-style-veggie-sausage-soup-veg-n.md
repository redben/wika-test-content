  An easy weeknight soup my children and i enjoy.  i'm sure any brand of veggie
  'sausage' would work, though you might want to boost up seasonings if you use
  a plain variety.  great with some nice bread on the side.  (the nutritional
  info will be off because it wasn't accepting the specific veggie sausage as an
  ingredient).

 - Warm the olive oil over medium heat , once warm add the onion and let it sweat for about 5 minutes
 - Stir in the tomato paste as best you can and let that sizzle more a few minutes , then add in the garlic
 - Let that cook a few minutes while you chop up the 'sausage' , then add it in along with the bay leaf , basil and parsley
 - Let the mixture cook for a few minutes then mix in the 1 / 2 cup of water , stir well
 - Leave that while you get the rest of the ingredients together
 - Add in the carrot then turn the heat up and stir in the broth
 - Bring to a boil
 - Once boiling , add in the orzo and barley
 - Stir well , reduce heat and allow to simmer over medium low heat for about 35 minutes
 - Stir from time to time as barley and orzo are prone to sticking to the bottom of the pot
 - Adjust seasoning and add peas and corn about 25 minutes into the simmering
 - Once the barley is cooked through the soup is done
 - You may want to add more broth , it gets quite thick , especially if you leave it to cook a lot longer
