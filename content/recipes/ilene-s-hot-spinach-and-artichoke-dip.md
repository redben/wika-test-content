 - Preheat oven to 375 degrees
 - Thaw and drain spinach
 - I find it easiest to do this by putting thawed spinach in a clean dish towel and wringing out the excess liquid
 - Add spinach , chopped artichoke hearts , parmesan cheese and 1 cup monterey jack cheese to a large bowl and combine till well mixed
 - In a separate bowl mix sour cream , mayonnaise , cream cheese , milk , cream , garlic , pepper flakes , salt and pepper till well combined
 - Add wet ingredients to spinach and cheese mixture and mix well
 - Taste for salt -- add a little more if needed
 - Pour into a greased casserole dish and top with remaining 1 / 3 cup monterey jack cheese
 - Bake for 25-30 minutes until bubbly
 - Serve with tortilla chips or baguette slices
 - Enjoy !
