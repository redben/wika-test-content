description: "Shadya saleh of lotus catering & fine foods (1960 lawrence ave. e., 416-757-8315) shares this recipe for egyptï¿½s national dish.\r\nyou can fry your own onions or buy them fried.  many asian grocery stores sell them.\r\nrecipe found in toronto star website.\r\nnote: when i made this i used long grain basmati rice rather than calrose. i've never had koshari before but this substitution seemed to work out just fine.\r\ni've changed the number of servings to 10 to 12 as i agree with the reviewer that this makes a lot more than 6 servings."
