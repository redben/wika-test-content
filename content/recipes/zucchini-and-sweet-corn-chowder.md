description: >-
  This soup is another of my favorites, besides being delicious it is rich in
  nutrients especially if it is prepared with organic ingredients.

  zucchinis are rich in calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, beta-carotene,
  vitamin b-complex, vitamin c, vitamin a and vitamin k. they are very low
  calorie vegetables. zucchinis skin is an excellent source of dietary fiber and
  offers some protection against colon cancers.

  unlike corn, fresh corn kernels have fewer calories and contain no gluten.
  yellow corn kernels contain high levels of b complex, vitamin a, lutin,
  flavonoids among other important nutrients, and contain a moderate amount of
  minerals such as zinc, magnesium, copper, iron and manganese. however, corn,
  in line with rice, potato, etc., is one of the high glycemic index foods,
  limiting its authority to the main food ingredient in diabetic patients. for
