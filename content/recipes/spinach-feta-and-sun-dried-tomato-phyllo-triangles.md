 - Position racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and heat the oven to 375f in a large bowl , combine the spinach , feta , mint , sun-dried tomatoes , olives , eggs , garlic , lemon juice and zest , pepper , and salt
 - Mix well
 - Unroll the phyllo and lay it flat on a clean , dry surface
 - Cover completely with plastic wrap
 - Working with one sheet of phyllo at a time , and keeping the rest covered with the plastic wrap to keep it from drying out , place a sheet vertically in front of you
 - Brush the phyllo with butter and cover with another sheet
 - Butter the top sheet and cut the phyllo lengthwise into equal 3-inch-wide strips
 - Spoon 2 teaspoons of filling on the lower end of each strip as shown in the left photo below
 - Fold up the phyllo strips as you would a flag to create a neat triangle , being careful not to roll too tightly or the triangles will crack when baked
 - Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with plastic
 - Repeat with the rest of the phyllo and filling until you run out of filling
 - Butter two sheet pans
 - Arrange the phyllo triangles on the prepared baking sheets in a single layer
 - Brush the tops of the triangles with melted butter and bake until golden brown , 15 to 20 minutes , switching the positions of the pans halfway through baking
 - Make ahead
 - Assembled , unbaked phyllo triangles can be frozen for up to a month
 - Freeze the triangles on the baking sheet
 - When frozen , transfer them to an airtight container , setting parchment or plastic wrap between layers if needed , and return to the freezer
 - Bake as directed above
 - Baking time will be 20 to 25 minutes
