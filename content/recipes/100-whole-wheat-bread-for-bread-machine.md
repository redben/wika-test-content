description: >-
  I based this recipe on one for "honey whole wheat bread" i found on the back
  of a bag of hodgson mill flour. i could never keep that one from falling in my
  bread machine, so i came up with this. there is literally no preparation
  involved, just throw all the ingredients into the container. it is the only
  completely whole wheat bread recipe i've used that turns out well for me,
  every time.
