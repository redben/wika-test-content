  I attended a cooking demonstration by lisa brink of hod hasharon.  lisa has
  her own cooking blog, www.deliciouskitchen.weebly.com, and has some wonderful
  ideas about cooking and presentation.  this recipe comes from her take five
  class, recipes which contain five main ingredients and/or take five minites to
  prepare.  i found this soup to be absolutely delicious and have already made
  up a batch for my family.
