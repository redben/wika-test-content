  This was adaptated from a cook book where each chapter was dedicated to
  special guest - in this case for the cookie chapter it was mother goose. when
  made with whole wheat pastry flour and leaving out the chocolate chips, i also
  refer to these as "better than cheerios for breakfast cookies". my kids always
  loved them, especially with the chocolate chips! you can use smooth or chunky
  p'nut butter, and quick or old fashioned oats. these are a firm cookie, great
  for sack lunches. cooking time is per cookie sheet.
