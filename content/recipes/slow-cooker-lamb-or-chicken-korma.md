description: >-
  A mild, rich, creamy curry. this recipe is adapted from "creamy lamb and
  almond curry" from slow cooking curry & spice dishes (humphries). instead of
  using creme fraiche, i used creamed coconut. delicious, and the meat just
  falls apart in your mouth! to grind the almonds, you can use a mortar and
  pestle.
