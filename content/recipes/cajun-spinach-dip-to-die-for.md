description: >-
  When in new orleans a few years back, i bought a copy of 'dat little cajun
  cookbook by chef remy (not the chef in ratatouille!). there are so many
  similar spinach dips out there, chef remy's is a little different and more
  "made from scratch". i made some minor adjustments which are reflected here.
  (if cajun seasoning is unavailable, use seasoned salt with a pinch of cayenne
  or red pepper flakes)
