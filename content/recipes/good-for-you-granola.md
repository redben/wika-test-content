description: >-
  This is a vegan granola recipe with added protein from hemp powder and flax
  seeds. it's a basic recipe with lots of room for alterations and additions-
  you can add different chopped nuts, dried fruits, and other seasonings like
  ground clove or ginger. i usually add more hemp powder, as i hardly notice the
  flavor.
