  When i was younger, i found this recipe in a children's betty crocker cookbook
  and its stuck with me ever since! over the years i've made a few changes, but
  its just as delicious as ever! a nice recipe because most people have american
  cheese in their house lying around - you don't have to go to the store and buy
  expensive fancy cheeses!
