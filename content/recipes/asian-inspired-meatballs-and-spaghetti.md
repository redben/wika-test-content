  This one is hot off the press from eat boutique blog.  the creator, denise
  woodward, said she's been developing this recipe for a year.  she finally
  nailed it by using pork instead of beef, chicken or turkey and even veal.  the
  sesame seeds add crunch to the meatballs and the sauce is definitely umami
  with it's sweet, sour and spicy flavors.  soba noodles completes the meal.
