 - Preheat oven to 350f
 - Butter a large casserole dish with 1 1 / 2 tbsp of butter
 - If you use a casserole dish that is about 9x13 , you'll have more surface area , more of the potatoes will brown , and the cooking time will be faster
 - Layer the bottom of the casserole dish with 1 / 3 of the potato slices
 - Sprinkle with salt and pepper
 - Layer on 1 / 2 of the sliced onions and 1 / 2 cup of the gruyere cheese
 - Layer on 1 / 2 of the bacon , 1 / 2 of the parsley and chives
 - Sprinkle with a little parmesan
 - Repeat by layering on 1 / 3 of the potato slices , sprinkle again with salt and pepper
 - Layer on the remaining sliced onions , 1 / 2 cup of the gruyere cheese , the remaining bacon , parsley and chives
 - Sprinkle with a little parmesan
 - Top the casserole with the remaining potato slices
 - Add the half and half
 - Dot the potatoes with the remaining 1 1 / 2 tbsp of butter
 - Cover the casserole with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for one hour
 - After an hour , remove from the oven , remove the foil , sprinkle on the remaining cheese
 - Return to the oven for an additional 30-40 minutes
 - When done , the potatoes should be tender , but not mushy , and the liquid should be mostly absorbed
 - In this case the total oven cooking time is about 35-45 minutes
