  Fresh cauliflower and broccoli from our garden - several recipes found, but
  all too fattening. putting together a recipe of my own. this recipe can be
  cooked on the grill. we did not add the panko and cheese, but they would be a
  great addition. which i will do today when i am reheating the leftovers.
