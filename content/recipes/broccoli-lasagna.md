  I got this from the real simple magazine. it turned out great, and was a big
  hit with my company. it is very easy to make, tasty and a little different
  than your typical lasagna. i am a huge fan of broccoli and was excited to try
  this. i decided to post it to make sure to save the recipe and i know that
  recipezaar fans will love this too!

 - Preheat over to 400 degrees
 - In a large bowl , combine ricotta , broccoli , 2 cups mozzarella , 1 / 4 cup parmesan
 - In small bowl , combine marina sauce and cream
 - Spoon layer of sauce on bottom of 9 x 13 pan , top with noodles , more sauce , cover with the cheese broccoli mixture
 - Repeat until it is all gone
 - Each layer put the noodles in a different direction it makes it easier to cut when you serve ! when top layer of noodles is down , sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and parmesan
 - Cover tightly with sprayed foil and bake 40 minutes
 - Uncover and bake until the top is golden brown
 - I double the recipe for a bigger group and use one of those "big lasagna" tins from the grocery store
 - Bake a larger sized lasagna about 15 minutes more
 - Also great to make ahead , freeze and bake later in the week !
