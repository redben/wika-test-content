 - In a large pan , saute the scallions and brussels sprouts in the olive oil on medium heat for about 8 minutes
 - The brussels sprouts should be mostly cooked before adding the orzo
 - Add the tomatoes and saute for another minute
 - Add the 2 3 / 4 cup of veggie broth and bring to a boil
 - Add the uncooked orzo , lemon juice and seasoning mix and give everything a good stir
 - Turn the heat down and let this simmer for about 20 minutes , until orzo is tender
 - Stir every now and then to make sure there is enough liquid to keep the orzo from sticking to the pan
 - If this happens , add veggie broth
 - Only add a little at a time because the excess liquid should be absorbed by the time the orzo is cooked
