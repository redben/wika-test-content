  This is the perfect summer cake, bright and sunny with the lemon flavors being
  the star, and i am not ready to give into fall yet. i am sure you can still
  find raspberries at the market, i was able to find them without a problem.

  the raspberries make it just a little more special than your typical lemon
  cake.

 - Butter a 10-inch round cake or springform pan , dust with flour , and tap out any excess
 - In a large bowl , sift flour and baking powder
 - Set aside
 - Place sugar and lemon zest in the bowl of an electric mixer
 - Rub the ingredients together between your fingers until the sugar is moist , grainy , and has absorbed as much of the zest as possible
 - Return bowl to mixer
 - Using the whisk attachment , beat in eggs on medium high until the mixture is pale and thick , about 3 minutes
 - With the mixer on lowest speed , beat in milk
 - Add reserved flour mixture
 - Beat until incorporated
 - Add lemon juice , melted butter , and olive oil
 - Beat until blended
 - Pour about one third of the batter into the prepared pan
 - There should be just enough batter to form a thin , even layer
 - Arrange the raspberries on top of the batter
 - Pour the remaining batter over the raspberries , and use a rubber spatula to gently spread batter so that it runs down between the berries and just covers them
 - Bake cake until it's golden and pulling away from the sides of the pan , and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean , about 35 minutes
 - Let cool for about 15 minutes before removing the cake ring
