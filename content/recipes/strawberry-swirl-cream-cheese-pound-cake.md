  This recipe caught my eye in the latest issue of southern living and i
  immediately had to try it.  wonderfully delicious!  my notes:  although the
  instructions stated to bake the cake for 1 hour 10 minutes, my cake had barely
  begun to rise by this time.  i had a total bake time of 1 hour 35 minutes
  before the cake tested done.
