  This is out of a cookbook called "patio daddy-o" 50's recipes with a 90's
  twist...if you plan to serve this with rice, try cooking the grains in coconut
  milk instead of water...i can see using my george foreman grill or any outside
  grill to cook the shrimp...cooking time does not include marinating
  time...hope you enjoy!
