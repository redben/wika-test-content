description: "That's right now you can make barbacoa as good as chipotle's at home! perfecting this recipe started as a bet... while my husband scott and his good friend steve were enjoying one of their many grad school barbacoa lunches from chipotle, steve made the comment, \"i don't think even jan could make it this good.\" oh, the challenge was on!\r\n\r\ni searched the web and found several recipes claiming to be the real deal but i decided to base mine off a copycat recipe i found on todd wilbur's top secret recipes. so how did it come out? let's just say steve ate his words and several of these burritos :)\r\n\r\nheads up, you'll need a crockpot for this one."
