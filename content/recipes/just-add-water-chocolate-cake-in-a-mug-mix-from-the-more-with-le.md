description: >-
  This is a mix to create individual servings like the warm delights, cake in a
  mug/cup craze. it is "just add water". it makes a rich, fudgy cake. this is
  suitable for gift giving. it does not use a cake mix to start, and does not
  use egg. it is prepared in the microwave. 4 tbl of mix filled my mug about
  half full, it does rise a little when cooking. this amount of mix will make 11
  cakes, or if your mug is big enough for a double batch it will make 5. if you
  just want to make one just decrease the yield to 1 cake. originally posted on
