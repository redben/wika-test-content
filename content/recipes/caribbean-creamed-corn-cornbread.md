 - Spray baking dish with cooking spray and pre-heat oven to 400 degrees
 - Whisk together all the dried ingredients and set aside
 - In another bowl , whisk together the eggs , milk and melted butter and add to the dried ingredients , whisking all the way until all the ingredients are well incorporated
 - Then add in peppers , creamed corn , celery and onions
 - Mix well and set aside for 15 minutes in order for the cornmeal to soak up all the liquids
 - This ensures a much more moist cornbread
 - Place in oven for 20-25 minutes or until the knife comes out clean
