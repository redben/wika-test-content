  I love the fact i just scoop these into a muffin tin and put them in the
  oven:  no frying in tons of oil, no flipping and worrying about them falling
  part.  also, pretty cheap since this recipe is for canned salmon, which i
  always have on hand.  a friend of mine found these on the taste of home
  website (published in healthy cooking february/march 2010, p53), and sent them
  to me after she raved about them.  a simple and healthy entree that goes great
  with steamed veggies and some rice.  one serving is 2 muffins.
