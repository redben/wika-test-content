title: Homemade Veggie Bouillon

description: >-
  This recipe requires a food processor. i have a 8-cup / 2 liter / 2 quart
  model, and needed every cubic inch of it. i found the best approach if you are
  tight for space in your food processor is to add a few of the ingredients,
  then pulse a few times. the ingredients collapse and free up more space for
  the next few ingredients. if you don't find yourself using much bouillon, i
  will suggest making a half batch of this. and for those of you wanting to do a
  version with no salt, freeze the pureed vegetables in small amounts - say, ice
  cube trays, just after pureeing them. introduce salt in whatever amount you
  like later in the cooking process.

 - Place the first four ingredients in your food processor and pulse about twenty times
 - Add the next four ingredients , and pulse again
 - Add the salt , pulse some more
 - Then add the parsley and cilantro
 - You may need to scoop some of the chopped vegetables on top of the herbs , so they get chopped
 - Mine tended to want to stay on top of everything else , initially escaping the blades
 - You should end up with a moist , loose paste of sorts
 - Keep 1 / 4th of it in a jar in the refrigerator for easy access in the coming days , and freeze the remaining 3 / 4 for use in the next month
 - Because of all the salt it barely solidifies making it easy to spoon directly from the freezer into the pot before boiling
 - Start by using 1 teaspoon of bouillon per 1 cup , and adjust from there based on your personal preference
 - Makes roughly 3 1 / 2 cups
