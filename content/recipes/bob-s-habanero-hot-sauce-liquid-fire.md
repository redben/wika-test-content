title: Bob S Habanero Hot Sauce Liquid Fire
date: 2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  Using fewer habanero peppers can reduce the spiciness in this extremely hot
  habanero hot sauce.  the sauce works wonders as a pick-up for bloody mary
  drinks.  flavors meld wonderfully and the sauce keeps nicely for a long time. 
  warning: a dash is all you need!  it is best to use gloves when handling the
  habanero peppers.  makes 64 servings.
