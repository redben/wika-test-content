title: How To Microwave A Whole Chicken

description: >-
  One sunday i thawed a whole roaster chicken for dinner but got caught up in my
  afternoon activities and got home with only an hour to get the thing cooked. a
  quick google search proved that you can, indeed, quickly cook a whole chicken
  in the microwave. i have done this twice now, and in all honesty it yields
  more tender and juicy chicken than when i roast them in the oven lol. another
  added bonus is that the skin is removed (it gets gooey, i'm told) so the
  fat/cholesterol is significantly reduced. give it a try--you may have found a
  new item for your "gotta get dinner done quickly" toolbox! also, feel free to
  change up the spices based on your mood!!

 - Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife , remove most of the skin from the chicken
 - This is easier than it sounds , especially with scissors
 - Place chicken breast side up in a microwavable pan
 - Mix salt and spices and rub all over the outer surfaces of the chicken
 - Place onion inside cavity
 - Set microwave power on 70%
 - Microwave for about 10 minutes per pound , so 35 minutes for a 3
 - 5 lb bird , 50 minutes for a 5 lb-er , etc
