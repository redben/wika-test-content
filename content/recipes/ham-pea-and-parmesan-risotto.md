  Very tasty and fresh risotto recipe for kids and adults, a great "comfort
  food" dish but nice enough for a dinner party. my 18 month old loves it! the
  addition of the lemon zest keeps it light instead of stodgy, so don't skip it!
  you can substitute a splash of lemon juice if you have no fresh lemons on
  hand. ham can also be substited for bacon, canadian bacon, or my personal fav,
  cubed pancetta. you can also add a clove of chopped or minced garlic in with
  the onion step, but i find there are enough flavors going on it doesnt really
  need it.
