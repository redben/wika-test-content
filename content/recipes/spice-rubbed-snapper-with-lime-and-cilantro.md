  Made this very easy, delicious snapper recipe from williams-sonoma last night
  and enjoyed it very much.  served over geema's recipe #63446 63446 for a
  really complimentary meal.  i used a tsp of fresh ginger instead of ground,
  otherwise made no modifications.  prep time does not include 30 minutes to
  marinate.
