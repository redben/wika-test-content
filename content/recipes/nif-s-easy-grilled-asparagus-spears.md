 - Trim off the tough bottom of the spear by grasping each end and bending it gently until it snaps at its natural point of tenderness - usually two thirds of the way down the spear
 - Place asparagus on a plate and drizzle oil over spears
 - Sprinkle with salt and then mix spears with your hands to coat
 - Place aspargus on medium-hot grill , horizontally so they won't fall through the grates
 - Occasionally roll spears with the back of a spatula so they rotate and cook all around
 - As they caramelize , asparagus should begin to brown in spots but should not be allowed to blacken or char
 - They are done when slightly wilted
 - Remove from grill and sprinkle with parmesan
 - Serve immediately
