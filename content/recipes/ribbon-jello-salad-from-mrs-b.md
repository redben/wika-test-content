  A favorite family gave us this favorite recipe.  this is time consuming and a
  bit of work so not for everyday.  but it is visually stunning and also
  delicious.  i like to substitute red and blue flavors with the white filling
  for 4th of july parties.  but the original rainbow is great, too.  be sure to
  use a clear glass pan if you can.

 - For filling: dissolve unflavored gelatin in cold water
 - Add milk , sour cream , sugar and vanilla
 - Beat well
 - Layer in 9 x 13 pan , chilling between layers
 - First layer: jello 1 , prepared as directed on package
 - Second layer: 1 3 / 4 cup filling
 - Third layer: jello 2
 - Fourth layer 1 3 / 4 cup filling
 - Fifth layer: jello 3
 - Sixth layer: 1 3 / 4 cup filling
 - Seventh layer: jello 4
 - Important
 - Let each layer set well before adding another
 - Also , let your prepared jello cool to room temperature before layering it into the pan on top of the previous layer
 - When you pour a new layer in , do not pour it directly on the previous layer
 - The stream of liquid may be strong enough to "slice" open the layer that is there
 - Instead , hold a large spoon down near the pan
 - Pour the liquid onto the spoon and let it gently cascade into the pan
 - The filling will probably set up before you get through all the layers
 - You can warm it gently to re-liquify
 - Just be sure it is not too hot when you pour it on the previous layer
 - Yes , it is worth it
