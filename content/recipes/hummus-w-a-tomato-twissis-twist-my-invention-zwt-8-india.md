description: >-
  Submitted for play in zwt-8, the starting-point of this recipe was a basic
  hummus recipe i found in a sml cookbook i got at heilsustofnun nlfi (an
  icelandic health spa). i chg'd it up a bit to suit our taste preferences &
  then added my "twissis twist". it's an easy quick-fix that has proven itself &
  is freq requested by our family & friends. the end-product is thick & i
  suggest reserving the liquid drained from the canned chickpeas to thin it as
  desired for your intended use. this recipe is also easily halved, but i've
  never done that as it's usually made for occasions & disappears quickly. yield
  was estimated - i just never bothered to ck that because i was happy. 10 min
  was allowed for ingredient assembly & 5 min for prep. *enjoy!*
