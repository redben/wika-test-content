 - Press tofu well and slice into 8 thick slabs
 - Whisk together remaining ingredients
 - Coat tofu in marinade
 - Marinate in the refrigerator for at least two hours , and up to overnight
 - Tofu tends to stick to grills , so prepare your barbecue with a non-stick cooking spray or by rubbing it with oil
 - Grill over a pre-heated grill for 6-7 minutes on each side , until browned , brushing occasionally with extra marinade
