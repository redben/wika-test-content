  From the red star nutritional yeast cookbook, these look yummy and use
  ingredients i have around my house that are cheap! (even though the
  nutritional yeast isn't the main star in this!) i didn't know what granules
  were, so i used onion and garlic powders in 1/2 tsp each and they turned out
  fine. because these patties use flour and oats, they are not gluten-free but
  they do lack eggs and dairy and are purely vegan. tvp and nutritional yeast
  are wonderful sources of protein and are inexpensive with long shelf life,
  making them perfect vegan staples! us veg-heads shall not be left out during
  bbq season!
