  This is a very homey comforting pork dish. it doesn't take a lot of work or
  ingredients. i was looking for something that would just taste good and have a
  wonderful gravy. the onions and garlic add a really nice mellow sweetness to
  the dish. i used yellow onions which are sweeter than white, but almost any
  kind of onion would work. i would not use red onions though because the flavor
  is much too strong. my family loves garlic so i used more, but make it to your
  tastes. my 2 year old gobbled it up. left overs are delicious!
