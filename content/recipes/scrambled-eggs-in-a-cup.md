description: "My grandmother passed down this recipe after i had my son.  this was one of his very first foods.  its easy to make, easy to clean up and easy to feed. even the pickiest of toddlers will devour this simple easily digestible meal.  after 10 years my son still asks for his eggs to be made this way and can even make them himself.  it is still his favorite way to eat his eggs :)\r\n\r\nalso makes a quick on the go breakfast you can eat in your car.  for adults add salt and pepper with your favorite cheese, spices or ketchup."
