  I am a pennsylvania gal through and through.  love the state, love the food
  and love the people.  one of my favorite pa treats are small cakes and
  cupcakes made by tastykake out of philadelphia pa.  a friend of mine loves the
  peanut butter kandy kakes so i came up with this recipe so that she can have
  the taste of them any time (even though you can order them from their
  website).  this is super simple box cake recipe that only takes minutes to
  make.  i think the reason it works is because of the particular brands of cake
  mix and frosting.  hope you enjoy.
