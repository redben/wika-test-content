  I love tasty food, especially when it can be made quickly and be made from
  ingredients i usually have on hand. i've cooked many recipes for dal over the
  years, eaten many varieties of dal dishes out at restaurants, and i'm always
  looking for the next best dal recipe that i can make at home. this is it!

 - In a medium sized pot over medium flame , add 1 tbsp peanut oil , 1 tsp garlic powder , 1 tsp ginger powder , and 1 tsp garam masala powder
 - Stir spices and oil together , allow to fry slightly
 - Add the dal and water to cover , turn the heat to high , and bring to a boil
 - Skim off foam that forms on top and discard
 - Cover and turn the heat to low
 - Allow to simmer until dal begins to fall apart and is cooked through
 - While cooking , monitor the water level
 - If it is too low , the dal will burn to the bottom of the pan , so add more water
 - If the water level is too high , uncover the pan so some will evaporate
 - When done , the dal should be a porridge consistency--not watery , but not burning to the bottom of the pot
 - Heat frozen green peas , drain excess water , and add to cooked dal
 - Taste dal and adjust salt
 - Since you have not salted the pan yet , you may need to add a few teaspoons to tablespoons of salt
 - Add slowly--you can always add more but it is hard to get rid of too much
 - Make the tadka: in a frying pan over medium heat add the butter , 1 tsp tumeric powder , 2 tsp garam masala powder , and 1 / 2 tsp red pepper flakes
 - Fry lightly until spices release their fragrance
 - Add the onion and fry for another few minutes to the softness you desire
 - Add the garlic and ginger and fry for another 2 minutes
 - Add tadka mixture to dal mixture and stir to combine
 - Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary
 - Serve spice kissed masoor dal over rice with yogurt , raita , red raw onions , cucumber , lettuce , tomatoes or other fresh vegetables of your liking
