 - Season yellowtail with salt & pepper on both sides , and place on hot grill
 - Grill to medium , as overcooking will lead to a dry finished product
 - While fish is cooking , place all ingredients for the pineapple salsa in a bowl and toss
 - When the fish is cooked , place a piece of banana leaf on the plate
 - Place fish on top of banana leaf and top with pineapple salsa , serve with rice and garnish with a grilled lemon
 - Salsa can be made 1-2 hours in advance , no need to chill
