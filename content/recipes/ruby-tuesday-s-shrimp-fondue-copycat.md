  measurements, so i made this up.  i like it, and my husband likes it more than
  the original. let me know if you have any tips to make it better!

 - Put sauce into sauce pan and add shredded cheese
 - Stir until all the cheese is melted
 - Add shrimp and stir until warm
 - Add pico de gallo just before serving
 - The shrimp and pico de gallo really add a lot of moisture , but if it is too thick , add a little milk , half & half or heavy cream
 - If you don't have pico de gallo , finely diced tomatoes and onions can be used instead
