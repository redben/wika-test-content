  Probably upstate new york's best-kept secret!!  the spiedie (which is
  pronounced speedy) gets its name from "spiedo", which is italian for
  spit...cubed meat, anything from chicken to venison, is marinated, skewered,
  grilled, and served in a hoagie roll. these chicken sandwiches may be a
  regional specialty of upstate new york, but now it's time for everyone to
  enjoy them...so, get your grill ready for memorial day, fourth of july,
  picnics, tailgate parties,and the rest of the summer and have a "spiedie"!!!
  :)  prep time does not include time to marinate.
