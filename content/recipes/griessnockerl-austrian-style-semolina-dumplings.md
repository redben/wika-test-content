 - Beat the eggs and melted butter until foamy , stir in the semolina , season with salt , pepper and freshly grated nutmeg to taste
 - Mix well and let rest for 10 minutes
 - Form oval quenelles with the aid of 2 teaspoons , drop them into boiling water , don't overcrowd the pot , they will plump up
 - Cook for 10 - 15 minutes or until they rise to the surface
 - Remove from the heat , add one cup of cold water to the pot and let stand for another 10 minutes , by now they should have doubled in bulk
 - Drain and serve in broth , sprinkled with chives and grated nutmeg
 - If the sample dumpling is not soft inside , leave them a little longer
 - It should be soft but not mushy
