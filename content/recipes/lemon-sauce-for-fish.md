 - When i originally wrote this recipe , i really didn't think about the garlic much
 - I was using peeled garlic
 - If you use a head of garlic , do yourself a favor: cut the head in half across the grain , and either use a garlic roaster , or wrap the head in foil tightly and bake for an hour at 250
 - That will loosen the cloves , and roasting will impart more flavor
 - Just squeeze each clove into the pan
 - Or mince the garlic until it's very fine
 - Melt the butter in a small pan
 - Add the minced garlic
 - Brown the mixture
 - Add the flour and whisk to form a roux
 - Add the lemon juice and milk
 - Continue whisking until the sauce is smooth
 - Hey ! you're done ! pour a bit over your fish and enjoy !
