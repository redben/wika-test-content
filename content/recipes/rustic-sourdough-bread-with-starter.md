 - In a measuring cup combine the warm water and potato flakes
 - In a large ceramic bowl whisk together the yogurt , buttermilk , yeast and sugar
 - Whisk in the potato water
 - Whisk in the flour until mixture is smooth
 - Cover with a loose lid or a large kitchen towel
 - Do not use a tight fitting lid-the gas from the starter could cause your container to explode
 - Set aside on your counter and leave it alone for 24 hours
 - Next morning
 - In the bowl of your ka or standing mixer combine the warm water , sugar and yeast
 - Give it a good whisk and let stand for 5 minutes
 - Whisk egg in a small bowl or measuring cup
 - Add starter to the bowl of your ka mixer-whisk well
 - To the yeast mixture add the egg , oil and 2 cups of flour
 - Give that a good whisk to get it somewhat smooth
 - Attach dough hook and turn mixer on to 1 or 2
 - Add one cup of flour and kneed for 2-3 minutes
 - Add another cup of flour and kneed for 2-3 minutes
 - Add 1 / 2 cup of flour and kneed for 4-5 minutes
 - You will want your dough to to be tacky but not sticky-by that i mean you want your dough to "just" pull away from the side of your mixing bowl
 - Turn out onto a lightly floured board or counter
 - Flour hands lightly and kneed for 2 or 3 minutes forming a nice ball-again it will feel tacky and somewhat soft
 - Turn into a large oiled bowl , turning once to cover ball entirely
 - Let rise 1 and 1 / 2 hours , or until double in bulk
 - Punch down and divide dough in half
 - Shape dough into whatever form you wish
 - I make one round loaf using a small , oiled cast iron skillet dusted with corn meal , the other i shape into a italian style loaf on a greased cookie sheet dusted with corn meal
 - Brush tops with oil , cover and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size
 - Slash tops with a razor blade or very sharp knife
 - Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped
 - Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes
 - Remove bread from pans / sheets and let cool on wire rack
