 - Add first three ingredients to a large slow cooker , layered in the order they are listed
 - Add the next ten ingredients to the blender and blend until smooth
 - Pour blended mixture over the potatoes , onions , and peppers
 - Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours
 - About one hour before you wish to serve the chowder , put the remaining two cups almond milk and the raw cashew pieces in your blender
 - Add several ladles full of the simmering chowder , making sure to get lots of potatoes
 - Blend mixture until completely smooth , then pour back into the slow cooker
 - Add the frozen corn , stir , cover , and turn up to high for one hour
 - Serve with fresh , crusty bread or rolls !
 - 2) if you are not concerned about calories or fat content , canned full fat coconut milk makes a wonderful substitute for the almond milk in this recipe
 - 3) for a smaller slow cooker , you may half this recipe
