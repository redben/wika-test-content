 - Preheat the oven to 325 degrees
 - Lightly grease and 8-inch square cake pan
 - Place the milk and 1 / 2 cup of the cream in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat
 - Be careful not to let it boil over
 - Place the eggs , egg yolks , 1 / 2 cup of the sugar , salt , and vanilla in a bowl and gradually add the milk mixture , whisking all the while
 - Add the melted chocolate and mix until it is fully incorporated
 - Place the bread cubes in the prepared pan and pour the custard over it , pressing down to dunk them
 - Let rest at least 15 minutes and up to an hour for the bread to absorb the custard
 - Pour the remaining 1 / 2 cup cream over the top and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and transfer to the oven
 - Bake until the pudding is firm and a knife inserted comes out clean , about 1 hour
 - Serve warm or at room temperature with caramel sauce , a dollop of sweetened whip cream or ice cream , and sliced bananas
