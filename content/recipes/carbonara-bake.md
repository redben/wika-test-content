description: "The flavor of spaghetti carbonara without having to need four hands to toss the pasta and pour the egg sauce on at the same time! \r\ni used skim milk, low fat dairy items and turkey bacon but feel free to use whatever fat content you want to! also if you don't want to use the whipped cottage cheese you can use ricotta. if you are a fan of penzey's spices try making your own italian sausage using their italian sausage seasoning. that's actually what i did here and mixed a tablespoon of it into a pound of ground beef. can't get any easier than that!"
