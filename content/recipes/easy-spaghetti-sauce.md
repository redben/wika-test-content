description: >-
  I was buying ragu my entire life and it was never quite enough or too much. it
  was also expensive compared to a can of tomato sauce. so i thought i'd try to
  make my own. i found out that it was super easy to do.

 - Add tomato sauce , tomatoes , tomato paste , basil , oregano , and bay leaf to a saucepan
 - Simmer with a lid on for about 1 / 2 hour to get rid of that 'canned tomato' taste
 - Ready to serve
 - Meat sauce variation:
 - After letting sauce simmer for about 15 minutes , i often add 1 lb browned ground turkey and 1 cup sauteed diced onion
 - I let it simmer another 1 / 2 hour and it is ready to go over pasta
 - Enjoy
