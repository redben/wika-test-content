description: >-
  My dad got this recipe from somewhere a long, long time ago in the 20's or
  30's and passed it on to mom and she passed it on to me in the 60's. you just
  multiply the amounts according to how much fish that you have to fry. i tried
  to post a photo for the recipes but the '"'powers that be''" will not let it
  be posted on the recipes. so i will not do any post of photos here, no
  recognition for it.

 - Excellent !
 - I did some chicken tenders , then some fresh flounder fillets , then some shrimp
 - It was all incredible ! next time i will make some hush puppies , and it will be just like eating at the restaurant !
 - This really was an excellent batter
 - I made it up an hour before i used it as i have heard that this makes batter 'stick' better to whatever you're frying
 - Anyway , it stuck
 - Light , crisp and not greasy
 - For fun i tried this on onion rings and i took some sweet banana peppers and split them and removed the seeds and battered them and fried to a golden brown , excellent
 - I think you could batter any thing with this recipe
 - Thank's dad !
 - I added a 1 / 2 cup of corn meal to the batter , also some garlic & onion powder to taste and / or fish seasoning
 - I also let the fish sit in the batter for 30 minute this made the batter a bit thicker on the fish and made it stick well
 - My entire family loved this recipe
 - I am also expected to make this recipe for my neighbor
 - She buys the fish i cook it
 - We now have an awesome batter for our fish
 - We all love it
