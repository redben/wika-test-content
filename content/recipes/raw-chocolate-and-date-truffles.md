 - If using regular dates , you must soak them for at least 6 hours , or overnight then drain well
 - Place the seeds and or nuts in to a food processer
 - Blend for a minute or so until a dense flour like consistency is achieved
 - Add the remaining ingredients and pulse a couple of times until the ingredients begin to stick together , almost like a dough
 - Use your hands to form small balls
 - Roll the balls in the remaining desiccated coconut to finish
 - The truffles can be kept at room temperature , but i find they are best kept in the fridge
 - Makes around 30 truffles
 - They will keep for 3-4 days
