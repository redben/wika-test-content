description: >-
  A tasty but more heart friendly variant of the oatmeal cookie. the family
  loves this oatty, nutty, cherry vanilla taste but we love even more that this
  is much lower in sodium and that the applesauce and flax seed cuts down the
  fat.they are good day one but keep some around for day two, that's when they
  are special!
