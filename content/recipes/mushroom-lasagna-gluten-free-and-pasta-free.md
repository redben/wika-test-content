title: Mushroom Lasagna Gluten Free And Pasta Free
date: 2010-02-12T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  Sauteed mushrooms replace traditional lasagna noodles, and their rich flavor
  and texture more than make up for the absence of meat. use 3 t. flax seed meal
  mixed with 1 t. water for egg-free preparation (as noted in the ingredients).
  gluten free pasta is available, but because i'm severely vitamin d deficient
  as a result of celiac disease which went undiagnosed for many years, i came up
  with this in order to take advantage of the vitamin d in mushrooms. the cheese
  and pasta sauce are the two critical ingredients that will make or break this
  dish. we have two sauces created by local restaurants that are available in
  many ohio grocery stores: larosa's and annarino's. they tie for first place as
  the best all-purpose sauce i've ever tasted. you might consider looking in
  your area for a good locally produced sauce ... but maybe we're just really
  lucky around here! i use mario batali italian four cheese blend because it's
  outstanding and loaded with flavor.

 - Preheat oven to 350 degrees
