description: >-
  I ate lots of lok lak on a recent holiday to cambodia. it's similar to
  vietnamese shaking beef although the cambodians don't like to admit that. in
  cambodia it might come with chips (fries) and a fried egg or rice-i liked the
  rice option. you eat it by wrapping portions of the meat and salad ingredients
  in a lettuce leaf, then dipping that in the dipping sauce (the best part of it
  i reckon). sometimes the meat is sliced, sometimes it's cubed-i prefer slices.
  semi ripe tomatoes are preferred to ripe ones, but use what you have!
