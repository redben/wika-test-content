  This is a recipe i came up with after i got tired of the same-old same-old.
  it's very rich and filling. most often 2 people can share one burrito and it's
  plenty. when you're done 'building' the burrito it will resemble a heaping
  salad. note: to save leftovers, wrap 'burrito only' in foil and freezer bag
  and place directly in the freezer. refrigerating leftovers will just make them
  soggy. also, i like to use 505 organic green chili sauce. it adds just the
  right flavor.
