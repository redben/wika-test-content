description: >-
  This marinade has all the ingredients of a margarita!  marinate the chicken
  breasts for an hour (not much longer, or the lime juice will start to cook the
  chicken) and then grill over medium-hot coals. servings are based on the
  number of chicken pieces.  if you have hearty eaters, this will not serve 8!
  delicious!
