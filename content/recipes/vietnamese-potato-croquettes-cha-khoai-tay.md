  Lightly spiced potato patties present a nice blend of flavors that make this
  old favorite a welcome departure from the ordinary. if you want to have the
  traditional dipping sauce, there are many recipes for nuoc cham on â€˜zaar: i
  use gourmet garden chili spice blend (in a tube in the salad section of the
  grocery stores), mixed into equal parts water, lime juice, soy sauce and rice
  vinegar to make it easier if not wholly authentic.
