 - Open up the sandwich rolls and scoop out most of the center
 - In a small mixing bowl combine 2 tablespoons of pesto with the tepanade , artichoke slices and stir to mix well
 - On the rolls: spread 1 / 2 tablespoon of remaining pesto on each side of the rolls
 - Divide the olive artichoke pesto mixture between the two rolls and spread on each roll
 - Take slices of the turkey , ham and salami and cheese and place on top of the olive mixture , dividing them between the two sandwiches
 - At this point you can make these hot or cold sandwiches
 - For hot::
 - Heat heavy cast iron skillet , place the two rolls and top with another pan or i use my tea kettle with water in it to squish them down
 - Heat through , turning over halfway
 - For cold:
 - Squish the two sides of the sandwich together and wrap tightly with suran wrap and place in fridge
 - This gives the flavors time to marry , serve and enjoy !
