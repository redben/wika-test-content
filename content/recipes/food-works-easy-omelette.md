  Food works co-ordinator allie didn't know how to make an omelette until she
  tried out the program recipes at home. this one's pretty easy! <br> fill it
  with any veggies you like and top with mozarella, cheddar, or feta cheese!
  <br> protip: a small frying pan makes a fluffier omelette.  try an 8-10-inch
  frying pan (slightly larger than the span of your hand)

 - Chop vegetables into tiny pieces
 - Try onion , spinach , tomato , asparagus , zucchini , or mushrooms
 - Shred cheese using a cheese grater , or use a slicer to make a couple thin slices
 - Preheat stove to medium-high , and put an 8-10-inch pan on the burner to heat up
 - Crack eggs into bowl and beat until frothy with a fork or whisk
 - Add oil to the hot pan
 - Add vegetables to the pan and cook lightly , just until things brown or soften up a little
 - Add eggs , and spread around pan to evenly distribute vegetables
 - Allow the eggs to begin to set , when the top is dry and does not wiggle when you shake the pan
 - To speed the setting , you can put a lid on the pan to firm up the top faster
 - When there is no runny egg left , add cheese to the omelette
 - When cheese has begun to melt , fold omelette in half with a spatula
 - If folded omelette is not golden brown on the outsides , cook for a moment longer , flip , and cook the other side
 - Serve hot
