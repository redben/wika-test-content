 - Preheat oven to 325f grease a bundt pan and dist it with cocoa
 - Mix flour , sugar , eggs , margarin , oil , zucchini , and vanilla together in a big bowl
 - In a small bowl , mix the dry ingredients: salt , baking powder , baking soda , cinnamon , cloves , nutmeg , cocoa
 - Alternately add milk and dry stuff to zucchini mixture , until all is mixed together
 - Pour into pan and pop it in the oven for 45min , or longer , depending on toothpick test
 - Recommended: drizzle with the chocolate chips just before putting it into the oven -- seems like shaved / sliced almonds would be grreat on it also !
 - Alternative topping: instead of the chocolate chips , use fudge icing recipe #78040 from this web site ( i tried a few frostings and this one was the best with this cake and so easy ! amazing consistency
