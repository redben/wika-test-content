  This slightly edited recipe comes to you from the awesome blog
  http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/ - i made it with ww flour, and it was super
  delish!  even the parrots went nuts for it!  (then again, they eat pretty much
  everything...)  i did toss the frozen blueberries in a heaping tablespoon of
  flour, to prevent blue muffins.  this is definitely a keeper!

 - Preheat oven to 325f degrees
 - Spray 15 muffin tins with nonstick spray
 - Set aside
 - In a large bowl , gently toss the flour , baking soda , salt , and cinnamon together until combined
 - Set aside
 - In a separate bowl , mix the honey and brown sugar together - it will be thick and lumpy
 - Try to get out as many lumps as you can - a fork works well to break it up
 - Add the mashed banana , yogurt , and beaten egg
 - Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients
 - Gently begin to fold it all together
 - It will be very thick
 - Add the milk slowly and continue to gently mix the ingredients together
 - The milk will thin everything out , but the batter will still remain thick
 - Gently fold in the blueberries
 - Do not overmix the batter , which will lend tough , dry muffins
 - Divide the batter between 12 muffin tins
 - Fill all the way to the top
 - Bake for 20 minutes until very lightly browned on the edges
 - A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean
 - Allow the muffins to cool completely
