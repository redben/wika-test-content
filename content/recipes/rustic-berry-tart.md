description: >-
  From eatingwell:  summer 2004, the eatingwell diabetes cookbook (2005).  the
  secret to this free-form tart is the layer of ground almonds under the
  berries: it thickens the juices, prevents a soggy crust and delivers an
  exquisite background flavor for the intense berries.  exchanges: 2 other
  carbohydrate, 1 fat (2 carbohydrate serving).  note: prep time includes 1 hour
  refrigeration time.
