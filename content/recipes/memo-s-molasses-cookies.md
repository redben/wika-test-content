  Delicious, soft, melt-in-your-mouth cookies.  this is actually a vintage wwii
  brer rabbit "molasses sugar cookie" recipe from when sugar was rationed.  as
  odd as it seems, do use butter-flavored shortening and not butter, the taste
  is buttery anyway and shortening will give you that perfect texture.  chilling
  the dough is also a must.  original recipe says "yields 4 dozen", but we only
  end up with 2 dozen.  prep time doesn't include chilling time.  family note:
  memo is mom-mom's mother: verdis pierce reasoner.
