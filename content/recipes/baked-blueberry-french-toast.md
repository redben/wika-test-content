date: 2010-04-05T00:00:00.000Z
description: "A recipe from my favorite vegetarian cookbook, i make this with double the berries (often using mixed berries) and low to non-fat dairy products with a whole grain bread for a more health conscious dish.  (this balances out my obsession and overuse of maple syrup!)  \r\ni've never had anything by rave reviews and recipe requests from this dish.  everyone is always in love with this new take on french toast.  top with some fresh maple syrup for lip-smacking yumminess!"
