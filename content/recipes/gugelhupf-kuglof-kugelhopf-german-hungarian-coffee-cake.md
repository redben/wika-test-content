description: >-
  However you spell it, it's a rolled coffee cake made from a raised dough that
  has a walnut/chocolate swirl inside.  this recipe was given to me by both my
  aunt (in-law) and mother-in-law.  the family always enjoy it during every
  holiday/family gathering and since i've been successful at making it, that job
  seems to have been past on to me- the tradition shall continue.  yay!

 - Into a food processor , place flours , lemon rinds , 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar and butter
 - Process until mixture is crumbly
 - Set aside
 - In small bowl , warm milk to about 115f stir in remaining tablespoon of powdered sugar and package of yeast
 - Let sit until bubbly
 - Separate 4 eggs - beat yolks and refrigerate whites , to save for filling
 - Add yolks to the yeast mixture
 - In large bowl place flour / butter crumbles and pour eggs / yeast over top
 - Keeping it inside the bowl , mix and knead the dough one handed until smooth - important: dough will be very gooey and sticky- do not add more flour , just work the bumps out
 - Once dough is smooth - cover bowl tightly with plastic and refrigerate overnight
 - Now work on your filling:
 - Place walnuts , powdered sugar and cocoa into food processor
 - Chop until walnuts are finally grounded
 - Transfer to a bowl and let sit inside refrigerator until dough is ready
 - When dough is ready: heavily flour your work surface
 - Remove dough from bowl and roll out into a large rectangle
 - Once that is formed , remove egg whites and whip them in a bowl until stiff peaks form
 - Fold in the grounded nut mixture
 - Spread this filling over the dough rectangle and starting at one side , roll it up like a jelly roll
 - Seal the finishing edge with a bit of water
 - Now lift it carefully and place it into a well greased and floured bundt pan
 - Set pan in a cold oven to continue to rise for 2 1 / 2 hours or until dough is near the rim of the pan
 - Now bake at 325f for 1 hour and 15 minutes
 - If during that time the top begins to get too dark before it's ready , lay a piece of foil over the top
 - Allow it cool , then turn out carefully
 - Serve plain or sprinkle with powdered sugar
 - Refrigerate uneaten portions to maintain freshness
 - Slices are good cold or warmed in the microwave
 - Enjoy !
