 - In a big bowl combine flour , butter cut into chunks , water , salt and egg
 - Knead into a smooth dough
 - Wrap in cling film and freeze for 10 minutes
 - Meanwhile heat oil in a pan and sautee veggies for 7 minutes or until done
 - For the sauce combine cream , 3 eggs , paprika , pepper and cheese
 - Set aside
 - Now line the base of a spring form pan with parchment paper
 - Roll out 2 / 3 of the dough into a circle of 26 cm diameter and place in the pan
 - Make sure to remove the sides of the pan when pre-baking the dough for the base
 - Prick with a fork and bake at 200c / 400f for 12 minutes
 - Take out and allow to cool for a minute
 - Grease the sides of the pan and place them around the bottom again
 - Form rest of the dough into a long rope and use this as the sides of your quiche
 - It works best if you place them on the bottom and use your fingers to connect them with the base and a spoon to form a high side
 - Fill in the veggies and pour the sauce over them
 - Bake another 25-30 minutes on the lower rack of your oven
