  I love this recipe because it's so delicious and super easy to  make. my
  family loves it, too! great served with caesar salad and garlic bread.  i
  usually have half of the sauce left over.  i either freeze it, or cook up
  extra chicken for leftovers, but the chicken does lose some of its crispiness
  on the second day.  note: one of my favorite things about this recipe is the
  crispiness of the chicken.  i usually use twice the oil that the recipe calls
  for, maybe even more.  i just keep an eye on it, and add more as needed.
