  This was one of my favorite tempeh recipes for a long time, and i am surprised
  it is not already posted here! it comes from the may 1998 edition of cooking
  light, and it is just perfect when you want a warm comfort food-ish yet
  vegetarian meal! i recommend cutting the veggies very small to get the most
  authentic "sloppy joe" texture.
