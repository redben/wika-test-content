description: >-
  After seeing this idea floating around the web, i thought i'd experiment a
  little.  three simple ingredients, no sugar added, no ice cream machine
  needed...  how much healthier and easier could it get?  this "ice cream" is
  smooth like soft serve and naturally sweet.  plus it has the potential for so
  many add-ins (dark chocolate chips, chopped strawberries, nuts... just to name
  a few).  please note "cooking time" includes time needed to cure in the
  freezer. if you are as excited as my 4-year-old was to eat this "ice cream",
  you may choose to serve it directly after turning out of the food processor
  instead of freezing for 2-4 hours, but please be aware that it will be soft
  and melt much faster.  my daughter, the best taste-tester around, approves,
  and i hope you do too!
