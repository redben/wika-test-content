  Adapted from championship bbq secrets for real smoked food by karen putman. 
  this is my favorite rub to put on anything that i plan to cook over fire.  i
  just love the sweet, smoky flavor- it adds to what you're cooking, rather than
  overpowering the natural flavor of the food. the author also uses jalapeno
  pepper powder in this, but i've never been able to find it, so i've left it
  out.
