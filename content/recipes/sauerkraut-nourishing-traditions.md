 - In a bowl , mix cabbage with caraway seeds , sea salt and whey
 - Pound with a wooden pounder or a meat hammer for about 10 minutes to release juices
 - You can also use your hands to squeeze the juices out of the cabbage
 - Transfer the cabbage and all of the juice in a quart-sized , wide-mouth mason jar and press down firmly with pounder until juices come to the top of the cabbage
 - The top of the cabbage should be at least 1 inch below the top of the jar
 - Cover tightly and keep at room temperature for about 3 days before transferring to cold storage
 - The sauerkraut may be eaten immediately , but it improves with age
