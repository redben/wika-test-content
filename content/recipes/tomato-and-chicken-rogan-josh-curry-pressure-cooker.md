title: Tomato And Chicken Rogan Josh Curry Pressure Cooker

description: >-
  This originates from a recipe from taste.com.au for tomatoe and chicken korma
  curry but we (the dh and i) tweaked to suit out tastes for a rogan josh. for
  this we used patak's spicy rogan josh with a 3 chilli rating but actually
  found it quite mild and so next time we are planning on adding some fresh hot
  chillies to add zing (the original recipe also gives instructions for
  casserole and slow cooker methods). for the onion due to introlerances issues
  i cut into wedges so the dh could remove so he would not ingest, the original
  recipe called for 2 large brown onions thinly sliced.  tomatoes in the
  original they added them just before serving but i cut a cross in the top of
  each tomato and dropped into boiling water for 1 minute, removed and let cool
  till could handle and then roughly chopped and added to the pressure cooker
  when cooking but dh reckoned he would prefer them finely chopped so they
  dissolved more and became part of the sauce..

 - Combine the yoghurt and curry paste in a large glass or ceramic bowl and then add the chicken to coat and cover with plastic wrap and place into the fridge for 30 minutes to marines
 - Heat oil in the pressure cooker and add onion and cook until golden , this took me about 10 minutes but i had wedges of onion , if thinly sliced would take about 3 to 5 minutes
 - Add the cooked onion and diced tomatoes to your marinated chicken mix and place in the pressure cooker , , i sealed in the pressure cooker and set the timer for high pressure for 15 minutes , it took 18 minutes to come up to pressure and then cooked for 15 minutes and then did fast release and then served over rice and with steamed vegetables and naan bread on the side
