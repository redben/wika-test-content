description: "By susan russo, a food journalist and blogger (food blogga). she recommends it with grilled steak, but i make it with grilled fish. she writes, \"if you’re making this salad ahead, hold off on adding the dressing and cheese until you’re ready to serve.\"\r\nthe char adds a smoky taste to the watermelon but does soften it a bit; if you're skeptical about grilling it this combination of flavors works so well together you can just use ungrilled melon."
