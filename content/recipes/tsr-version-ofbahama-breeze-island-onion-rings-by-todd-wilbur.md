 - Make chili-horseradish sauce by mixing all the ingredients in a small bowl
 - Cover and chill
 - Make citrus-mustard dipping sauce by mixing all the ingredients in a small bowl
 - Cover and chill this sauce , too
 - Combine flour , salt , paprika , black pepper , onion powder , and garlic powder in a large bowl
 - In another bowl , combine breadcrumbs and coconut
 - In a third , smaller bowl , combine beaten eggs and milk
 - Bread each ring by first dipping it in the egg and milk mixture , then into the flour blend
 - Go though this first step with three or four onion rings , allowing them to sit in the flour blend for a bit so that the flour has the time to set up and stick to the onions
 - Dip those onion rings back into the milk and egg , and then back into the flour blend , allowing them to rest a bit again
 - Now dip the rings back into the milk and egg and then into the breadcrumb and coconut blend
 - Repeat this step again , dipping the rings back into the egg and milk and into the breadcrumbs , then let the rings rest on a plate
 - When all the rings are breaded , allow them to rest for 30 minutes so the breading will stick when the rings are fried
 - Preheat 4 to 8 cups of oil or shortening to 350 degrees in your deep fryer
 - Fry 2 to 4 onion rings at a time for 1 to 2 minutes or until light brown
 - Drain the fried rings for a minute or so after they come out of the fryer , and then arrange them in three towers of 5 onion rings each , with the 16th onion ring stacked on the middle at the top of the three stacks
 - Serve the dipping sauces on the side in small bowls
 - Enjoy !
