  I got this "in a hurry" salsa recipe from the mccormick's website.  the
  chipotle chile powder that i use is pretty hot and it is not mccormick's, so i
  might scale the powder back a little next time.  brought this to a party and
  it was eaten in a hurry.  because it requires very little chopping, it was
  ready quickly.  i easily doubled the recipe with good results.  prep time does
  not include 30 minutes in the fridge.
