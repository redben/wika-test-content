description: >-
  From the royal caribbean international cookbook, which states that chimichurri
  sauce is as common in argentina as ketchup is in the united states.  i've seen
  a few other posted recipes for chimichurri sauce, but none that have quite the
  same list of ingredients that are included in this recipe.  prep time includes
  marinating time.
