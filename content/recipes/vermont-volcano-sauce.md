  If you like hot and sweet, have i got a treat for you! i got some real 100%
  pure maple syrup from a friend and created this sauce one day as a tapas for
  fried shrimp. i have since served it as a dipping sauce for chicken fingers,
  and used it as a marinade/basting sauce for chicken and fresh whites fishes.
