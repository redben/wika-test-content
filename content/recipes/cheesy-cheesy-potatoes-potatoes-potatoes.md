description: "Ready, set, cook! special edition contest entry: being a former cook in restaurants, you learn to utilize everything. one time we had frozen hash brown, left over baked potatoes & mashed potatoes. i came up with a similar recipe using them. i still make huge pans of them when i cater & get raves about them.\r\n\r\nhaving simply potatoes just makes it so much easier & i can have these anytime, without leftovers. i twisted my original recipe using the ingredients listed & it was just as good, if not better. i hope you enjoy as much as we do. this goes well with almost any dish. we had it today with roasted chicken & fried green beans."
