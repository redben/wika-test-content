  You will love these for christmas. my dad taught me this recipe, if i can do
  it (i have lousy hands...lol), you can do it. how did i get the sprinkles and
  drag√©es to stick? i used a thin coating of brown rice syrup that i painted on
  with a small brush (brown rice syrup is a liquid sweetener made from brown
  rice, that is just about half as sweet as sugar). serving size really depends
  on how big or small you make them, i put 20 as an estimate. have fun and
  enjoy!!!
