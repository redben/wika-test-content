  Portillo’s is a chicago institution, a hot dog stand that was started in 1963
  by dick portillo’s in a small trailer with no running water, and has now grown
  to 47 locations.  their chopped salad is famous.  the italian dressing is
  from  the chicago sun-times. it is similar to the dressing found on salads at
  portillo's and maggiano's restaurants. tip:  if you make the dressing ahead of
  time and add a little bit to the cooled pasta and let it soak it up in the
  refrigerator for added flavor.  also, i believe chopped grilled chicken is in
  the original recipe.
