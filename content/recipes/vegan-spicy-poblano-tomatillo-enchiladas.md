  I made recipe #273482 spicy chicken tamales one christmas and my family
  inhaled them.  the sauce was just so crazy great it makes you crave more.  as
  a vegan and a person very into health, i decided to try to work that sauce
  into a healthy, vegan enchilada version and the result is a crazy addictive
  concoction that disappears in no time.  for ease, i make this as a layered
  casserole but traditionalists can roll 'em up.

 - Put the tomatillos and peppers in a pan under the broiler for 7 minutes or until they char
 - Turn them and keep them in for 5 more minutes
 - Empty the tomatillos and peppers into a food processor with garlic cloves and process until very smooth
 - Put the vegetable blend into a large saucepan with the broth and add lentils
 - Cover and cook until lentils are tender and turn off the heat
 - While that cooks , drain your beans , put them in a bowl and partly mash them
 - Add the beans , cilantro and nutritional yeast into the cooked lentil mix and stir together
 - While that settles , make the enchilada sauce by melting together the flour and margarine to make a roux , then whisking in broth , tomato paste and chili powder
 - Stirring constantly , cook over medium / high heat until thick and bubbly
 - Add a dash of cayenne or chipotle to taste if you like it a little hotter
 - You can make this casserole style or traditional roll-up style
 - Coat the bottom of your pan with a 1 / 2 c of the enchilada sauce , then spoon the filling into tortillas and roll them , placing them closely in the pan , then top with enchilada sauce for traditional rolled enchiladas
 - Coat the bottom of the pan with 1 / 2 c of the sauce , then layer tortillas , filling , sauce , tortillas , filling , sauce , tortillas , sauce if making casserole style
 - If you like a cheesy top , sprinkle on daiya or nutritional yeast then cover the top of the casserole with foil
 - In honesty , i can only recommend daiya if you want a vegan cheese
 - Every other vegan cheese i've tried tastes gruesome
 - The recipe is amazingly flavorful without any cheese , but if you must , use daiya
 - Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes , then remove the foil if you've topped it with daiya for the final 10 minutes
 - Without cheese , you can keep foil on the whole time
