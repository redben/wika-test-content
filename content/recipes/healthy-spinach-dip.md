  I came up with this based partly on the knorr recipe and partly on a recipe i
  found on pinterest for low fat, high protein ranch dressing using cottage
  cheese!  i am posting to get the nutritional content : )  i also highly
  recommend trying spinach dip with the new dill flavored triscuits!  yum!
