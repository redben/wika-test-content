  Found at the biggirlssmallkitchen website, this easy-fix & sure-to-be-tasty
  sandwich was featured by kelsey brown in a “brown baggin’ it” article
  primarily directed at college students & the working masses who dine in “break
  rooms” more often than not. kelsey said: “make your fellow students or
  co-workers jealous when they’re unwrapping their frozen “diet” entrées & you
  whip out this fresh, light & flavorful moroccan chicken salad sandwich in pita
  bread.” do not be intimidated by what may appear to be a complex set of
  ingredients. the ingredients are simple & the rest is a matter of spicing.
  ingredient prep & assembly time was estimated. there was no cook time since
  the recipe begins w/pre-cooked chicken. enjoy!
