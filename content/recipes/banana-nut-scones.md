  I made these up this morning when we were looking for a different flavour of
  scone for breakfast - and well, the very ripe bananas were calling me! i went
  easy on the sugar in the scones, and i sprinkled the top with turbinado sugar
  and oats to mimic a cruchy topping. these are not your typical buttery scones,
  but hearty, healthy, and hold you till lunch scones! if you don't have
  cinnamon chips, add a tbsp brown sugar, or you might wish to add raisins or
  chocolate chips, if you like your banana bread that way.  this is my basic
  scone formula - i just change up the fruit and nuts to keep it interesting!
