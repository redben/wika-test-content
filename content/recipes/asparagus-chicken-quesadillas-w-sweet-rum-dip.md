  This is truly an international take on the classic quesadilla, filled with
  some of my favorite things! throwing caution to the wind, its a blend of
  french, asian and carribean ingredients with a nod to the humble yet grand
  quesadilla. to keep the ingredient list and directions short, i've used
  store-bought crepes. but crepes are really quick and easy to make - so do
  yourself a favor and use one of the many great crepe recipes on this site! my
  personal preference for the cheese is brie (soooo good with the sweet sauce!)
  but mozzarella is probably really good,too! this recipe was created for
  raiders of the lost pantry game, 2013. time does not include cooking the
  chicken filet. as an appetizer, these can be made in advance of your party and
  pan-toasted at the last minute.
