  Great when you need a chocolate fix, these brownies are laced with the taste
  of peanut butter and the crunch of walnuts. only use a wooden spoon to mix the
  batter so the brownies are more dense, like a brownie should be! this recipe
  was a contest entry for rsc #15. enjoy! ***please note*** due to feedback, i
  changed the cooking time to 25-30 minutes instead of 35-45. i think my oven is
  a little cooler than what it should be. i usually have to cook things a few
  minutes longer then listed.
