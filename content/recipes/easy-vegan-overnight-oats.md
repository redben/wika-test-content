description: >-
  This is from ohsheglows.com and it is so easy, and so healthy, and so tasty,
  you're going to make it every day! you can eat it as is, or add in a tsp of
  sugar or maple syrup if you want it sweetker. (it really depends what kind of
  milk you use.  vanilla almond milk wouldn't need the sugar or vanilla for
  example.) i usually add a little ground flax too to put this in the
  over-the-top good for you category.
