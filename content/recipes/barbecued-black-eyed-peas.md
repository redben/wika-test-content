description: "A fantastic alternative to the ho-hum baked beans served at bbqs.\r\nthis tasty side can be served hot at the bbq or cold as a salad type dish.\r\n\r\nreally good the day after. just add some more liquid and warm slowly, covered.\r\n\r\nblack eyes have a natural smoky flavour and  go really well with bbq or just try as a side dish with whatever!\r\ni have had this recipe for about 30 years and just love it when i rediscover the wonderful blend of tastes.\r\nfor best results, do not use canned black eyes - although, speed may require that you do... the taste won't be the same.\r\n\r\nwell worth the effort of soaking and preparing.\r\n\r\ntime of preparation does not include soaking time."
