description: "From foodtv, one of the malnati brother's gives this recipe.  i use it for both deep dish and thin crust pizza.  makes a lot.  i make the recipe, split into 4 pieces, freeze three then use one.  the cornmeal makes it special and it is very very close to a real lou malnati's pizza.  sometimes  i put the cornmeal on the bottom of the pan before putting in the dough, sometimes i mix it right into the dough.\r\n\r\n* i just noticed a 1 star review, the only review, complaining there was no corneal in the recipe written by someone who must not have read the last ingredient in the recipe...cornmeal.  please don't let the one star review stop you from trying this pizza crust."
