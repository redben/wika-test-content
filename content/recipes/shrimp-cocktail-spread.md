  This is from an old best of bridge cookbook that has been served at many
  parties and is always the first thing to be gobbled up. if you run out of
  crackers people will eat it with spoons! you can use light versions of cream
  cheese and mayo but i can't tell you what the results would be like. feel free
  to add another can of shrimp if you want it shrimpier.
