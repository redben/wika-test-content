title: Fettu Skinny Alfredo Healthified

description: >-
  This dish, made as directed, has more than enough sauce to coat the pasta, so
  if you like to have plenty of protein at each meal, adding shrimp or
  extra-lean grilled chicken is a great option.  for another 100 calories, you
  can add 3 1/2 ounces of grilled shrimp or extra-lean grilled chicken.  and if
  you want to make the dish even leaner, omit a little bit of the butter.  it's
  still rich and creamy without it, it just won't have that really buttery
  taste.  from the most decadent diet ever cookbook by devin alexander, author
  of the biggest loser cookbook.
