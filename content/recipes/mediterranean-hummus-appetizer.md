title: Mediterranean Hummus Appetizer

description: >-
  Inspired by zea's hummus appetizer platter.  refrigerate time not included. 
  (so good i strongly suggest doubling the hummus recipe since you'll already
  have on hand the toppings.)  note:  i made a remarkable discovery.  adding
  lemon zest makes for extraordinary so i added it as an optional ingredient. 
  update: substituting about half of the olive oil with chickpea juice makes for
  a fluffier hummus.  note:  since originally posting this recipe, i've come to
  realize that boiling your chickpeas for about 5 minutes makes for a better end
  product.  make sure you reserve the juice should you want a thinner hummus. 
  should you cook your own chickpeas from dried, use 1 1/2 cups drained
  chickpeas to equal the amount in a 15 ounce can.
