description: >-
  This is a different and lovely bread to serve as a snack or with "caldo
  verde"  (portuguese kale soup), salad or any meal of your choice.  the
  "chourico" is pronounced "chureeso" and is different than the mexican
  chourizo.  it's a delicious sausage and i remember my parents making it from
  scratch, back in the old country when they slaughtered the hog.  if you live
  near a portuguese ethnic area, there should be no problem finding this
  sausage, but of course you can use any sausage of your choice.
