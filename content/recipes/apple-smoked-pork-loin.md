description: "In less than three hours time a luscious smoked pork loin can be prepared and served to your hungry guests. instead of smoking for hours and hours until the pork is falling apart tender, the pork loin is smoked until it just reaches the stage of medium done...about 155 degrees fahrenheit.\r\n     a whole pork loin is one of two strips of meat that lie on each side of the porker's backbone. many folks confuse the loin with the tenderloin. the difference is that the loin is on the outer side of the body cavity...the tenderloin is on the inside. the tenderloin is smaller and more tender than the loin. however, the loin is still pretty darned tender. and less expensive, too."
