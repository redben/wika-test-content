description: >-
  I've searched for this recipe for several years, ever since i worked at the
  red hot & blue restaurant in savannah, ga.  i finally managed to get ahold of
  the store manual's recipe, and this is scaled down from it.  it will still
  make a fair amount, about 12 servings...but once you try it, you'll be
  grateful for that extra, cause it won't last long!!!

 - Steam the potatoes skin-on for approximately 45 minutes
 - Set aside until cool enough to handle
 - Boil your eggs , then do the same
 - When cool enough , peel the eggs only
 - In a large bowl , mix the remaining ingredients together until thoroughly mixed
 - Chop the potatoes and eggs into bite-size pieces and add to bowl
 - Mix gently -- you want salad , not mush -- until blended
 - Serve at room temp for up to 2 hours after making -- refridgerate leftovers
 - It tastes best when room temp , but is delicious cold too -- so if you are making this in advance , it's fine to chill it
 - Just let people salt it at table to taste !
 - Wanted to say thanks to all the reviews ! here's another hint to make this easier: when you are going to make boiled eggs , always make sure you buy the eggs at least 7-10 days in advance
 - Why ? because as an egg matures , it develops a small air "bubble" inside it
 - Having this bubble makes it a breeze to peel the eggs once they've cooled completely
 - You want your eggs to be around 10-12 days old , and it takes , on average , 2-3 days to get them from the laying facility to the store
