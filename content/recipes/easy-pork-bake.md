description: >-
  This is just like the recipe you find on the back of a stove top box, except
  we use pork rather than chicken and don't premix the stuffing.  the others i
  found on this site that were close do not include the mixed vegetables. 
  typically though instead of purchasing bags of mixed veggies, we just mix our
  own from the frozen veggies we have on hand.
