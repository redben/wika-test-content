  Totally addictive appetizer!  dill pickle rounds are the center of attention
  when wrapped in a blanket of cream cheese spread deli meat.  an interesting
  appetizer i wanted to try after chef enjenn3 described it in topic of the
  month thread.  i searched and was surprised that the recipe wasn't posted
  here.  i found different versions of it on allrecipes and cooks.com.  i took
  both versions and spliced them together, based on my previous experience
  making similar appys, and here you have it.  herb-flavored spreadable cream
  cheese could also be used instead of regular.  i got about 5-6 pickle rounds
  out of each pickle, but it will depend on how big they are to begin with.
