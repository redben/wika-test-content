  This is basically a standard french bread loaf recipe scaled up and modified
  for 4 hoagies, with my own observations and tips regarding making them
  suitable for eating sandwiches. the key point is that biting through the crust
  of a roll into a sandwich requires a crust that isn't tough.

 - Combine yeast with tepid but not warm water and let sit until convinced the yeast isn't dead , 10 minutes maximum
 - In a large bowl , combine most of the flour , oil and salt , add the water / yeast , and stir / add flour until the ball pulls away from the bowl
 - Sprinkle flour over a kneading surface and over the ball , and knead for about 7 minutes
 - Lightly oil a bowl and allow to rise until doubled , usually about 50-60 minutes if in a barely warm place
 - Punch down the dough , divide into quarters , and shape into 4 hoagies roughly 6" x 3
 - 5" or so
 - Allow to rise for 20 minutes
 - Preheat the oven at 425 , with a baking stone in the center rack and a ceramic dish on the bottom while the bread rises
 - Transfer the rolls to the stone , return the stone to the center rack , and turn the heat down to 375
 - For each of the first 4 minutes baking , toss a dash of water across the bottom of the ceramic dish to create steam
 - The rolls should be medium brown and more than doubled in height within 29-30 minutes
