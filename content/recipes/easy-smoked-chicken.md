description: >-
  This chicken gets its flavor from the smoke of the hickory chips, so i don't
  baste with a barbecue sauce while cooking this recipe....feel free to add it
  if you think it's necessary. i do like to offer recipe #248912 posted by
  oolala when serving it. it's important to use skin on chicken halves because
  the chicken is cooked for a long period over indirect heat.  i have the
  butcher at my grocery store cut whole chickens in half for me to make it
  easier on myself.
