description: >-
  Recipe from southern living february 2014.  this seriously easy and decadent
  mousse hides a secret: reduced-sodium soy sauce! just 1/2 teaspoon elevates
  the deep, rich flavor of the dark chocolate. add crunch with cookies to
  contrast the mousse's silky texture. heating store-bought shortbread for five
  minutes in a 350f. oven opens up the flavors of the buttery cookies.
