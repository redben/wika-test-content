  I have been searching for the perfect vanilla cupcake recipe for a long time,
  and i've found that most of them are dry. i finally changed a recipe and it
  makes the perfect vanilla cupcakes that are moist and not too dense. you can
  frost these cupcakes with many different types of frosting like vanilla,
  chocolate, strawberry, and more.
