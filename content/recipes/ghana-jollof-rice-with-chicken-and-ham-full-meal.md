  In jollof, the rice is cooked along with other ingredients, rather than as a
  separate starch. jollof contains just about everything you need for a one-dish
  meal. i think this recipe is so flavorful and delicious. i find myself going
  back for seconds of the rice with veggies. don't skip the cabbage (unless your
  really hate cabbage) because it really adds flavor to the rice. yum!!  i omit
  the ham. recipe from chef angela shelf medearis.
