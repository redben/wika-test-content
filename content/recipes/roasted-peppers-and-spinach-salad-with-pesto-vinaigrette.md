description: "Taken from sobeys inspired magazine spring 2011 with adjustments. you can use yellow or orange peppers if you prefer.\r\ni cut the original recipe back to serve two, but didn't change the dressing amounts, so you will have some leftover. \r\nprep time does not include roasting of the pepper."
