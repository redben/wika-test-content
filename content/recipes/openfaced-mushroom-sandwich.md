  This recipe is from scandinaviafood.com.  it is a popular lunch or snack in
  sweden, particularly in the fall when the chantarelle mushrooms are in
  season.  i remember picking fresh chanterelles in the forest in the
  netherlands when i was camping as a kid, and making a very similar sandwich on
  the camp stove.  to date, it was the best sandwich i ever recall eating.
