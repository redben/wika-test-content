 - Combine all filling ingredients in heavy sauce pan
 - Bring to a boil and stir to keep smooth
 - Reduce heat to medium and let mixture simmer uncovered
 - Correct flavor for spices and salt balance
 - As water simmers away , stir often to prevent mixture from sticking , especially during final stages
 - Cook until all liquid evaporates
 - If ground meat has a lot of fat , drain off at this point
 - Let mixture cool slightly before stuffing
 - Fill won ton wrappers with 1 to 2 tsp of filling
 - Moisten and press the edges together in a triangle shape
 - Fry the sanbossas , several at a time , until golden brown on both sides
 - Place the golden brown sambossas on paper towel to rid of excess oil
