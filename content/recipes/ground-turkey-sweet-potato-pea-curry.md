description: >-
  This recipe was somewhat inspired by banriona's recipe #408979, which i
  thought was a great americanized twist on a classic lebanese recipe.  in the
  same vein, this is like a flavorful indian curry crossed with a traditional
  stew.  no rice or naan needed, as it's very filling.  perfect for a cold
  winter night!
