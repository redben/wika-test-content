 - Cut away and discard the stem from the center of each kale leaf
 - Coarsely chop the kale into 1-inch pieces
 - It will look like you have a lot of kale , but it will cook down considerably
 - Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat
 - Add the tomatoes , thyme , garlic , shallots and red pepper flakes , if using
 - Saute until the tomatoes and shallots soften , about 4 minutes
 - Add the kale and sprinkle with the salt
 - Toss with 2 wooden spoons until the kale wilts but is still bright green , about 2 minutes
 - Stir in the basil
 - Remove from the heat
 - Fill a wide shallow pan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a gentle simmer , barely a bubble really
 - Meanwhile , using tongs , toast each tortilla directly over high heat until beginning to blacken in spots , about 15 seconds per side
 - Put the warm tortillas on plates
 - Spoon 1 tablespoon of hummus on each tortilla and spread to cover , leaving a 1-inch border
 - Divide the kale mixture over the hummus
 - Add the lemon juice to the barely simmering water
 - With a wooden spoon , stir the water briskly to create a vortex in the middle of the pan
 - Crack an egg on the counter and break it directly into the center of the vortex
 - Stir the water gently again around the outside of the egg to help the white fold up around itself
 - Cook until the white is just set and the yolk is still very soft , 2 to 3 minutes
 - Using a slotted spoon , remove the egg from the water and dab on a towel to remove excess water before moving it to one of the wraps
 - Continue with the remaining eggs
 - Slit the yolks and press on the eggs a bit so the yolks begin to run
 - Fold up the bottom of each tortilla and then fold in the sides , leaving the wraps open at the top
 - Serve
