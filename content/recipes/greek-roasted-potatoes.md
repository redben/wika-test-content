 - Preheat the oven to 350f
 - Cut the potatoes lengthwise into thick wedges
 - Place in a 9 x 13 inch baking dish
 - Wisk together the remaining ingredients and pour over the potatoes , coating evenly
 - Bake for approximately 2 hours or until tender , turning occasionally
 - Add water as needed if the pan is getting dry
 - I like my potatoes to have some colour , so i will broil them for a few minutes at the end until i get my desired result
