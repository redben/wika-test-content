  This is a great multipurpose recipe. you can use the "fluff" as i call it, on
  any type of fruit: rasberries, blackberries, strawberries, blueberries,
  pineapple, oranges, etc. it's light tasting and even great in the winter with
  frozen berries mixed with sugar. preparation time varies depending on if you
  use frozen fruit or cut fresh fruit. makes a great presentation with little
  effort.

 - Cube angel food cake with a serrated knife
 - It's easier if you handle the knife lightly so you don't crush the cake
 - Cream together the cream cheese , powdered sugar , 1 / 2 teaspoon vanilla extract and almond flavoring
 - Add the sour cream to the cream cheese mixture and blend thoroughly
 - In a separate bowl add 4 tablespoons powdered sugar to the whipping cream
 - Whip until soft peaks form
 - This step works best if you chill the whisk and metal bowl ahead of time
 - Mix the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until thoroughly combined
 - Clean and rough chop the fruit as is necessary
 - Mix it with 3 tablespoons powdered sugar or to taste
 - Layer angel food cake with cream cheese "fluff" and berries or fruit
