  This recipe is from recipe+ and as we are hoping to reap some red cabbage soon
  i am saving this recipe here for possible use.  it was also suggested you
  could use beef mince instead of chicken but honestly i think any lean
  minced/ground meat would work.  this reminds me of a sum choy bow but using
  cabbage leaves instead of lettuce.
