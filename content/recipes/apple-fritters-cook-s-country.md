title: Apple Fritters Cook S Country

description: "Regardless of their variety or whether they were sliced or grated, the apples in our apple fritters exuded juice and produced soggy, undercooked interiors. we found that the best solution was to dry the apples with paper towels and mix them with the dry ingredients. the dry ingredients sucked up the moisture that would otherwise have leached out during frying.\r\n\r\nwe like granny smith apples in these fritters because they are tart and crisp. apple juice doesn’t have enough flavor—you really do need the cider. penzeys extra fancy vietnamese cassia cinnamon is the test kitchen’s favorite brand."
