  Found in all*you magazine many years ago.  i love making this dish for our
  family - very simple and i can tweak it with different toppings so it always
  seems just a bit different.

 - Slice pineapple into eight rings and cut each ring into 8 pieces
 - Warm butter in a large skillet over medium high heat
 - When butter begins to foam , add the pineapple and brown sugar
 - Cook , stirring frequently and make sure you are turning the pineapple chunks over while stirring
 - This should take about 4-5 minutes - just until the pineapple is brown and all the sugar is dissolved
 - Remove from heat and place into a shallow serving bowls and let cool 2-3 minutes
 - Place a scoop of ice cream / frozen yogurt on each serving and top with other toppings if desired
 - Or you can serve with just a dollop of freshly whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon
