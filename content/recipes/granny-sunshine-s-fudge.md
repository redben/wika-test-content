description: "My husband's grandmother has made this fudge for more than 50 years. she used to use marshmallows rather than fluff, she finds fluff easier to use.  she finally chose to share the recipe with the rest of us after more than 30 years of being asked for it.  \r\nhope she doesn't see i posted it for everyone!\r\n be sure to not allow any water into the recipe, for it causes grittiness that ruins the whole batch. not. one. drop."
