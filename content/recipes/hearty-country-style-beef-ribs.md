description: >-
  I found the basic recipe in the 2009 edition of taste of home quick cooking
  cookbook. the original recipe was sent to them by helena ivy of st.louis,
  missouri. her recipe used short ribs and mushrooms, and mine uses carrots and
  country style boneless beef ribs.i also used golden mushroom soup instead of
  cream of mushroom.the amount of pepper used is strictly up to you. as with
  most crockpots cooking times will vary, so adjust accordingly.i served this
  over mashed potatoes, but i'm sure either rice or noodles would also be
  good.submitted to " zaar " on january 15th, 2010
