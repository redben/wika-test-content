 - 3

 - My
 - First , why did i end up with 24 , not 12 , of these mini muffins as the recipe indicates ? could it be that i misprint ? mine is a standard , mini-muffin tin
 - Second , i really don't like nutmeg much
 - So why do i love these muffins ? ! and why can't i stop popping them in my mouth ? don't kid yourself by thinking that because they're small you won't eat as much
 - You'll just eat more of them
 - And making them in the mini muffin tins was genius , dianne ! that way you get more of that buttery , cinnamony sweetness in every bite ! i did make a couple of modifications , but nothing that would significantly alter the recipe
 - I used butter instead of margarine and , because i have an entire quart of buttermilk to use , i subbed buttermilk for the milk
 - This worked beautifully , but please
 - This recipe makes 24 mini muffins
 - You fill the muffins cups 1 / 2 full with batter , and they should rise to just above top of the muffin tin
 - You can certainly also make 12 larger mini muffins if you wish , but "officially" this recipe makes 24
 - I think 12 has worked for me because my muffin tin is on the bigger side
 - Sorry about the confusion !
 - I dare you to eat just one -- with that in mind the only thing i would do differently next time is to double or triple the recipe because these don't last long
 - I sprayed a little pam for baking in the bottom of my mini-muffin cups so they'd pop right out
 - I can't wait to make these with my niece as this is definitely a kid friendly recipe
 - I put in a little less than 1 / 2 tsp of nutmeg
 - I also coated mine in powdered sugar , vanilla glaze and a chocolate glaze
 - We all like the vanilla glaze best ! here is the recipe i used for my vanilla glaze 2 cups confectioners' sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 tbs milk 1 tbs butter , softened put that into a bowl and mix together
 - I added more milk , but i didn't measure
 - I just got it to the consistancy i liked
 - Once i mixed it , i poured have of the glaze into another bowl and added 1 tbs cocoa powder and mixed
 - Then i dipped the muffins in the glazes and let dry
 - I double dipped them
 - Then on the vanilla glaze ones , i dipped some of the tops in the chocolate glaze
 - Also , glaze them once they have cooled
 - If you don't wait , they will fall apart
