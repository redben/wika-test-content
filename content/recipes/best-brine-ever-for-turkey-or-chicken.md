description: "Pretty brazen of me, isn’t it?  naming this the best brine ever? better than the good eats turkey brine, even?  well when you start with a thomas keller recipe and tweak it a bit…. what? who would dare to “tweak” a thomas keller recipe?  oh, yeah, i’m a little crazy like that!  i used this on a turkey, and it turned out to be the “best turkey ever!!” according to my husband.  i can only imagine the magic it would work on a chicken!\r\nthe original recipe can be found in thomas keller’s cookbook ad hoc at home, this is my (very slightly changed) recipe\r\n\r\ncooking time = brining time"

 - Combine all the ingredients in a large pot , cover , and bring to a boil
 - Boil for 1 minute , stirring to dissolve the salt
 - Remove from the heat and cool completely , then chill before using
 - The brine can be refrigerated for up to 3 days
 - For turkey , place the thawed bird into a food grade plastic bucket , pour the cooled brine over top , add ice water to completely submerge the bird
 - Place the lid on the bucket and keep cold overnight at least 12 hours
 - Remove from brine , take out any of the aromatics that may be hiding in the cavity of the turkey , pat dry and let the turkey come to room temp for a few hours before you put it in the oven
 - For chicken brine the bird up to but not more than 12 hours , ive not used this recipe on chicken but ive read the warnings of people who have left chicken in this brine for too long and it comes out salty !
