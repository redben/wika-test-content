description: "I like store bought cinnamon raisin bread for breakfast, so i started making this to save some dough. get it, dough? hahaha...heh.\r\n\r\n1.5 lb loaf, from my fave bread book.\r\n\r\ni think i will add more cinnamon in the future, though this bread is omg delicious when you spread butter on top and sprinkle a mixture of cinnamon sugar on top, then microwave it for 10-30 seconds. mmm calories taste so good!"
