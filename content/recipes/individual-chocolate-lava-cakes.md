  A delicious and fun recipe that can be made up to a week prior to the actual
  baking of them (great for a dinner party). i will say that my first attempt
  was a failure, but my second attempt turned out beautifully. lots of fun for a
  busy get-together to make 'ahead of time'. serve with a scoop of vanilla ice
  cream you have your cake & ice cream with a wonderful chocolate syrup! this is
  a recipe that i got from a pbs television program (but i cannot remember what
  the name of the show was). enjoy.
