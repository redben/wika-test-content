  I got some organic curry chicken sausage from my local farmer's market, but
  was stumped about how to cook it.  i just experimented, and this recipe is the
  result.  i used the curry chicken sausage the first time i made this, but the
  second time i used an italian-style chicken sausage, and it was good too.
