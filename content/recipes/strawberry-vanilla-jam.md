  This recipe is an adaptation/mash-up of the strawberry jam recipe in the book
  titled well preserved by mary anne dragan and the strawberry vanilla jam
  recipe in the book titled put 'em up! by sherri brooks vinton that also
  includes my own additions! the butter is optional and will help tame the
  foaming but don't use more than 1/2 teaspoon as this may raise the ph too high
  making your finished product unsafe to can. the lemon juice should be bottled
  instead of fresh because bottled has a more reliable and consistent ph where
  as fresh can vary. this makes wonderful gifts that are a bit more special than
  just regular strawberry jam! i usually get 6 half pint jars and a quarter pint
  jar out of this recipe.

 - Simmer the strawberries over medium low heat for 10 minutes
 - Add the lemon juice , vanilla extract , seeds scraped from the vanilla beans , butter and sugar and stir well until sugar is dissolved
 - Bring the mixture to a boil over medium high heat and boil hard for 20 minutes , stirring frequently , until it has reduced and thickened a bit
 - You may test for gel at this point if deisred
