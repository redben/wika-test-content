description: >-
  One of my co-workers used to come running in with a cucumber, couple of
  carrots, fresh lime and a jar of chili powder, she would slice the veggies and
  toss with the lime juice and sprinkle the chili powder every few bites or so
  as a way of having a quick on the run lunch without eating fast food.
