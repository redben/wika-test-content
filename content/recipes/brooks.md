  My grandmother's dear friend indabelle passed this recipe on to our family.
  these were a big hit with everyone, and we all enjoyed getting in the kitchen
  to help make them. even when we were little we could help pinch the roll mix
  shut, and nothing was more fun than slicing a hot brook open and slipping in a
  slice of cheese to melt. my grandma always made lots of extras and froze them.
  they are easy to pop in the microwave for a good comfort food snack, and you
  don't have to eat the hot roll part, so you can save yourself the carbs by
  discarding it once it's done its job melting your cheese!
