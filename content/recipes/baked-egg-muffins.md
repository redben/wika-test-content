  Recieved this online from all recipes, tried it and loved it.  quick, easy and
  tasty what more could you want.  i made mine to a medium soft egg as we like
  and topped with fresh salsa and sour cream;  but think you could scramble
  also.  i'm going to try freezing the extras for a quick micowave breakfast on
  those morning we're in a hurry.
