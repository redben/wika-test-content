  A cold, creamy, luscious summer potato & leek soup recipe i found on
  thenibble.com.  this was created by a french chef and it is traditionally
  served cold can be served hot for those in their winter months.  i have had
  this soup (cold) and loved it, but this one is untried by me at this time. 
  posting for the french leg of zwt with minor changes for my taste and texture.
