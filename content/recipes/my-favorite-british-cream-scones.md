  These are light, tender and so easy.  i work with a bunch of u.k people and
  one of them was kind enough to share this recipe with me because i kept on
  complaining how difficult it is to make good scones. you can add currants,
  other dried fruit, citrus zest, nuts, etc. - just stir it into the flour
  mixture before you add the cream. i personally love them with dried
  cranberries and orange zest.
