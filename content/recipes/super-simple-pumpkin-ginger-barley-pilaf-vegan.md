  Labor-intensive barley? not on my watch! and i love the millions of non-pie
  uses for pumpkin, this is yummy, filling, healthy, and has a little bite.
  wanna use fresh ginger (or the dried root pieces sold in ethnic grocery
  stores) for extra bite? grate/grind up a piece about 3 inches (7-8 cm) long.

 - Rinse and sort through your barley to pick out any rocks , twigs , etc
 - And while you're doing so , salt 2 1 / 2 cups water with the celery salt , and bring it to a boil
 - Turn the heat off once it's boiling
 - Make your sauce by first whisking the pumpkin and olive oil into the water , then adding the ginger , white pepper , and a little nutmeg and whisk until the pot is totally orange with no dry spices floating at the top
 - Turn the heat back on low to medium-low , and add the barley
 - Loosely cover and let cook for about 20-30 minutes if using quick-cooking barley , about 40-45 minutes if using traditional barley , stir a few times throughout the cooking to make sure it's not sticking to the bottom of the pot or if it takes less time to fully cook
 - I used normal storebrand traditional barley pearls and it only took 25 minutes to fully absorb
