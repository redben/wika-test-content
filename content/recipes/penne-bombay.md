  This is out of the 2004 edition of kcts chef's cookbook. it was sent in by
  antonio mauro the executive chef from anton's pasta bar in burnaby bc. the
  original recipe called for 20 oz of pasta for 2 servings. no wonder the
  portions are so big at restaurants. i changed it to 8 oz and decreased the
  half-half also to 8 oz. it was 18 oz. hope this works. 10/12/13...i finally
  made this...it sure is restaurant quality...but it still made a lot...i even
  cut the recipe in half and got at least enough for 2 helpings...just something
  to keep in mind when making...you can taste just a slight hint of the
  curry...it's not overpowering...it's really quite easy to prepare...just have
  all your ingredients ready...
