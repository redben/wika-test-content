  I looked through all, many similar, but mine enough different i decided it
  warranted being submitted separately.  my granddaughter wrote and asked for
  the recipe - what recipe? - so i wrote back and told her how i usually made
  it.  but it's a little different now.  i wish i'd had some green and red
  peppers but passed them up at the store.  it turned out nice but am hoping the
  flavors will blend together overnight.  i make my italian meat sauce similarly
  but use garlic and italian spices which i don't for this.  i used 2 packets of
  swanson flavor boost, and the editor will not recognize it.  it's very
  concentrated broth and new on the market.

 - Start cooking the pasta shells in 3 quarts of boiling water to which a few drops of salad oil and a little salt were added
 - Stir occasionally
 - Cook eleven minutes for well done , drain , don't rinse , set aside
 - Next i browned the onions in some margarine and scraped into small dish to set aside until the meat is browned
 - Turned up the heat and put in the ground beef , started breaking it up with spatula
 - Continued to brown the beef and break up with a little cookie-cutter type chopper with sharp , scalloped teeth (use whatever you prefer as a utensil
 - Brown to me is parts are actually a nice brown , not just stirring around until all the pink is gone
 - It helps with the flavor
 - When beef was browned to my satisfaction , put the onions back into the skillet with the browned , broken-up beef
 - Added the tomato paste , diced tomatoes and water , stirred on low heat
 - Add the flavor booster and did a taste test because it's salty , just right
 - To avoid over salting , i didn't use any salt except what i boiled the shells in until i added the booster
 - Add the seasoned salt , seasoned pepper blend , parsley , worcestershire sauce and cheese
 - If it's too thick , add a little more water
 - If too watery , cook it down while stirring , doesn't take long
 - Can be eaten right away , baked in oven , frozen , or made a day ahead
 - Add ground pepper to taste when served
