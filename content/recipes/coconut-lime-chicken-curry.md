  I came up with this recipe, trying to copy my favorite from a local indian
  restaurant.  adding the green chile salsa is what finally did the trick! 
  although they don't serve it this way at the restaurant, i stir-fried some
  vegetables and mixed them in before serving.  served with cilantro lime rice
