  This got many rave reviews on the other site. however, most said it was too
  thick. so some added about half the liquid from the canned chick peas, a
  little more olive oil and more lemon juice.  i think some roasted red pepper
  would be good. good basic recipe that you can adjust to taste, for our tastes
  i will most likely add more of the seasonings, and add a dash of cayenne too.
