description: "I think this makes a perfect holiday salad.  i will be making it for thanksgiving and will report back. \r\n\r\nsource: food52. com / brigidc's. this is her description of the salad. \r\nsweet, salty, tart, crunchy and spicy, this salad has perfect flavor and texture balance. the inspiration was pomegranate molasses, which i learned about when i worked on a persian food class. i like how the molasses takes the acidic edge off the vinaigrette but it is still tangy and delicious.\r\nbe sure to try this no fuss, no muss recipe  recipe #446884\r\ni made my own pomegranate molasses: recipe #490458 it's easy and can be reduced to make a smaller amount.  it can be stored up to 6 months."
