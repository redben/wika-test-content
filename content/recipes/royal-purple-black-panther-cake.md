 - Make the cake:
 - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
 - Spritz three 8 x 2 inch round cake pans with vegetable oil and line with parchment paper rounds
 - In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment , beat the butter and sugar on high speed for two minutes
 - Scrape down the bowl using a rubber spatula
 - With the mixer on low speed , add the eggs one at a time until incorporated
 - Add vanilla extract
 - In a medium bowl , whisk together the cake flour , baking powder and salt
 - With the mixer on low speed , add the cake flour in three additions , alternating with the milk and finishing with the flour until a smooth batter forms - about one minute total of mixing total
 - Fold in a tablespoon or more of purple gel food coloring to get your desired shade of purple
 - Divide batter evenly into prepared pans and bake for 22-25 minutes , checking the cakes for doneness at 22 minutes
 - Let cool completely on wire racks before frosting
 - Make the buttercream:
 - In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment , beat the butter on high speed until creamy
 - Scrape down the sides of the bowl , turn the mixer off and add in the icing sugar , cocoa powder , vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of milk
 - Cover the mixing bowl tightly with a damp tea towel
 - Turn the mixer back on to low speed until ingredients are fully incorporated
 - Add the black gel food coloring and mix until incorporated
 - With the mixer on high speed , beat until about doubled in volume
 - Add more gel color and milk a tiny amount at a time , if needed
 - Let the buttercream sit overnight to fully darken
 - Assemble the cake:
 - Level your completely cooled cake layers if need be
 - Place a dab of black buttercream on a cake board or cake plate and place the first cake layer cut-side-up on the board
 - Using an offset spatula , frost the first layer with a generous amount of buttercream
 - Add the second layer , cut-side-down , and frost the second layer
 - Add the third cake layer , cut-side-down , then frost the entire top and sides of the cake , using a cake bench scraper to smooth if desired
 - Chill your cake in the fridge or freezer while you make the fondant face pieces
 - With completely dry and clean hands , assemble the fondant pieces for the black panther face
 - I used white fondant for the lines and pre-colored purple fondant and large teardrop cookie cutters for the eyes
 - You can hand-cut all the pieces using a sharp paring knife
 - I used pre-colored black fondant for the ears , attached with wooden bbq skewers cut to size
 - Remove the chilled cake from the fridge
 - Lay down the face pieces on the fondant - the chilled cake will make it easier to move pieces around should you not like the placement
 - Once you are happy with the pieces , press gently into the buttercream to adhere
 - Fill a piping bag fitted with a large multi-opening grass
 - Carefully pipe around all of the fondant pieces and fill in the entire face
 - Pipe the sides of the cake !
 - Add the black fondant panther ears
 - Using silver glitter paper and sharp scissors , cut out five triangle pieces to resemble t'challa's necklace
 - Attach each piece to a wooden skewer cut to size and carefully place into the cake , being sure not to touch the glittery paper to the buttercream !
 - Finish with a wakanda forever cake flag using alphabet stamps or letter stickers !
