 - Peel and halve the red onion and cut into very fine half-moons and put in a small bowl to steep with juice of two limes to bring out the transparent pinkness in the onions and diminish their "onion-ness
 - "
 - Remove the rind and seeds from the watermelon , and cut into approximately 1 1 / 2 inch triangular chunks or use a melon baller
 - Cut the feta into similar sized pieces and put them both into a large , wide shallow bowl
 - Add chopped mint , along with sprigs of parsley if desired
 - Pour onions , along with their juices , over the salad in a bowl , add olive oil and olives , then using your hands toss the salad gently so that the feta and melon don't lose their shape
 - Add a grinding of black pepper and taste to see whether the dressing needs more lime
