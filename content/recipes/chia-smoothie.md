description: "I cannot handle a really thick, sweet, rich, and cold smoothie in the morning, but still wanted to try a healthy breakfast meal-in-a-drink.  this suits perfect but is still filling and stays with me until lunch.\r\n\r\nmake chia gel by grinding 2 tbsp. chia seeds then stirring into 2 cups of water.  this will get thick and gooey and keeps in the fridge for over a week.\r\n\r\ndepending on the sweetness of the fruit, you may want to adjust the honey to taste.  use green tea, or your favourite herbal or fruit blend.  i use an immune boosting blend i get locally."
