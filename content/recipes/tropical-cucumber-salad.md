  My friend buffy gave me this recipe.  i really didn't think that it would be
  that great, but it really is! this salad is very light and refreshing and
  would be the perfect side dish to a light summer meal.  i think that it would
  pair perfectly with grilled salmon or seared tuna.  best if made within an
  hour or two of serving. does not keep well overnight.
