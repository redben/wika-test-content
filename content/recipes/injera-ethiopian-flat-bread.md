  This recipe comes from classic international recipes.  this dish is popular in
  ethiopia, and is used to scoop up stews, or "wat". the recipe information
  states that it is similar in taste to buttermilk pancakes, but thin, like
  crepes.  traditionally, injera is formed into a large circle.  i posted this
