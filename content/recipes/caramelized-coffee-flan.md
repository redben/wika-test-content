description: >-
  Ooooh!  flan!  with a carmelized crust....and a hint of coffee
  flavor...luscious!  only make when you have company, so you don't make a pig
  of yourself!!  it's important to use a nice heavy saucepan to carmelize the
  sugar so it doesn't scorch or burn.  prep time does not include the 8 hour
  chill time!
