 - Add the dried elbow pasta and boil for 12 minutes or until cooked
 - Drain water and cool the pasta thoroughly
 - Combine all remaining ingredients and chill for at least 1 hour

 - The onion in the macaroni salad at l & l hawaiian bbq is very small , more like minced
 - After dicing your onion , be sure and rinse it in cold running water to remove any bitterness
 - I never measure out the mayonnaise , just add enough until i am satisfied
 - The cookbook recommends using best foods or hellman's mayonnaise
 - I often add 2-3 tablespoons of milk right before serving to make sure that the pasta is moist enough
 - The original recipe adds one small can of oil based tuna , but i haven't seen it added to the salad when i have ordered it
 - Some reviewers are commenting that the recipe is too salty and that the salt should be reduced , so please keep that in mind
 - I think that i just add to taste , but the 2 teaspoons is what is in the original recipe in the cookbook

 - Update may 2014: i checked with my local l&l hawaiian bbq and they do not put tuna in their macaroni salad , it is totally vegetarian
