 - Starting very slowly whisk the oil into the egg yolk mixture

 - Continue whisking in the oil until it is all incorporated
 - Can be refrigerated up to one week
 - Combine chicken with enough mayonnaise to moisten
 - Fold in the celery , scallions and herbs
 - Season with salt and lots of pepper
