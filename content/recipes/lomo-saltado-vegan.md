description: >-
  Lomo saltado is a peruvian dish with chinese influences.  this dish is
  normally prepared with beef tenderloin, potatoes, and vegetables and served
  with rice - but this version ditches the beef!!  the recipe calls for wheat
  gluten strips but you could also use seitan, tofu, or portabella mushrooms. 
  look for jarred aji yellow paste or aji amarillo paste in a latin food market.
  if you can't find the paste, you can use frozen aji amarillo peppers (south
  american hot yellow chile pepper) or equivilant pepper. thaw and dice one
  pepper, and saute it in olive oil until it's soft. this recipe is from vegan
  international.
