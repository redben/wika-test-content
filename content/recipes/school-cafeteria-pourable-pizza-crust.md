description: >-
  Pourable pizza crust from a quantity 1988 usda school cafeteria recipe. made
  in a half-sheet pan  (13" x 18" x 1") . the recipe makes a nice, soft bread
  like crust. this is the pizza crust that's been served at schools for the past
  25 years. this recipe would be really good for something like a kids birthday
  party. the dough has the consestency of very thick pancake batter. you pour it
  into a sheet pan, with the help of a rubber spatula. i like it because it
  saves all the rolling and fussing with normal pizza dough.
