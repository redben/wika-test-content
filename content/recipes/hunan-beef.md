description: "I love hunan beef but could not find any on this site.  i found this by lila voo\r\nbellaonline's chinese food editor.  i learned that hunan is a region in china known for their hot and spicy food.  this uses thai chilies, so if you don't like heat, you may want to remove the seeds the first time you make this."

 - Cut it across the grain into thin 1 inch slices
 - Place the beef slices in a container with a tight fitting lid and add the marinade in the following steps

 - Next add the soy and stir
 - Then sprinkle on the cornstarch coating each piece

 - Let the meat marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes
 - While the meat marinates , chop the thai chilies into tiny pieces , set them aside
