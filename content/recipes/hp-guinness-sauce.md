  A lost classic...  from 2011 to 2013 i fell in love with hp guinness sauce
  only to discover it's no longer made.  as my reserve is almost gone, i set out
  to reverse engineer it and this is the result.  it's very close to the
  original by my palette, is excellent on nearly all meats and as a dipping
  sauce for anything fried!
