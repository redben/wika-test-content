description: "If you don't want to make many gallons of this soup, here's a version scaled down for the home cook, adapted from serious eats.\r\ni use mexican crema instead of cream, tempered with a bit of the hot soup before adding.\r\nmake sure to use dried basil, it won't work well at all with fresh because of the cooking time.\r\nalthough this allegedly makes 4 servings, i got 6 generous bowls of soup."
