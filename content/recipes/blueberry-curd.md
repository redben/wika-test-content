 - Place the blueberries and lime zest in a covered saucepan with 1 tablespoon water and cook gently , shaking the pan occasionally , until very soft
 - Press through a fine sieve into a heatproof bowl or the top of a double boiler , then stir in the butter and sugar and put over a saucepan of gently simmering water
 - Do not allow the bottom of the bowl to sit in the water
 - Heat gently , stirring , until the sugar has dissolved and the butter has melted
 - Strain in the eggs and continue to stir over gently simmering water until the curd thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon , which should take 30-40 minutes
 - Stir only occasionally at first , more frequently as the cooking progresses , then constantly toward the end so that the curd cooks evenly and does not curdle
 - The water must not boil
 - Strain the curd , if necessary , into clean , dry jars
 - Refrigerate up to 2 weeks
