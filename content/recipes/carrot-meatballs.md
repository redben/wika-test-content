description: >-
  This is a variation from an old betty crocker cookbook.  my son asks for these
  regularly!! they're a great way to get kids to eat veggies, they're fairly low
  calorie, and scrumptious, to boot!  we usually eat them with rice and salad. 
  i also tend to make a double recipe because they're great as leftovers, too. 
  (if you get tired of making meatballs, save the meat and make more the next
  day, or make an egg stirfry with spinach!  that's tasty too, i've found!) 
  also, please keep in mind that the prep-time listed is for using a salad
  shooter or similar for grating the carrots.  if you don't have something like
  that, doing the grating by hand should add another 15 minutes or so, depending
  on you!
