 - Preheat oven to 350f degrees
 - Sprinkle lamb with salt and black pepper
 - In a large skillet over medium heat , cook lamb in olive oil until brown on all sides
 - Transfer to a rectangular baking pan with 2 to 3 inch high sides
 - Set aside
 - In the same skillet over medium heat , add 1 tablespoon olive oil , 3 tablespoons butter , onion , celery , carrots , bell pepper , and garlic
 - Brown vegetables in olive oil and butter , stirring occasionally
 - Stir in tomatoes including liquid , turmeric , paprika , cumin , ginger , saffron , salt , one lemon quarter , brown sugar , and water
 - Bring to a boil
 - Pour tomato mixture over browned lamb in baking pan
 - Wrap pan tightly with aluminum foil
 - Bake at 350f for 4 hours or until tender
 - Remove foil
 - Add zucchini , parsley , and cilantro and additional water if needed
 - Increase oven temperature to 400f degrees
 - Recover with aluminum foil
 - Bake for 45 minutes longer or until zucchini is tender
 - Remove lemon quarter and serve
 - Optional final step: the final step that restaurant marrakesh performs before serving is removing the lamb and zucchini from the pan
 - Then , transfer leftover sauce and vegetables back to the skillet that was used to brown the lamb
 - Bring to a boil , and simmer the sauce until reduced a little on the stovetop
 - Then , strain the sauce , discard the vegetables , and serve sauce over the lamb and zucchini
 - I do not perform this final step because i like eating the onion , celery , carrot , and red bell pepper which have absorbed the flavorful spices
 - Restaurant marrakesh serves their roast lamb meshoui with a side of roasted eggplant pure , but i like mine over jasmine rice
 - This is not their couscous with lamb shank
