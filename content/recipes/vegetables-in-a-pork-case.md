  Recipe from 'marvellous meals with mince' caption at beginning of chapter
  'some hae meat an' canna' eat, an' some hae nane that want it, but we hae meat
  an' we can eat, an' so the lord be thankit!' - people find this dish
  intriguing.  it is rather like a pie with a crust made of meat instead of
  pastry  the mixture of vegetables, similar to ratatouille, is encased in
  minced pork flavoured with tomato, garlic, mustard and rosemary and combined
  with wholemeal flour.  i serve it with fried potatoes and a simple green salad

 - Make the vegetable filling first
 - De-seed the peppers and peel the onion
 - Chop both up roughly
 - , pour boiling water over the tomatoes , drain and skin them
 - Chop the tomatoes and the mushrooms up roughly
 - Preheat the oven
 - Heat the olive oil and butter in a large heavy frying pan
 - Add the chopped peppers and onion and dry gently , stirring quite a bit until softened
 - Then add the chopped tomatoes and mushrooms and cook for only a minute more
 - Season with salt and black pepper , remove from the heat and let the mixture cool in yhe pan while you prepare the meat case
 - To make the pork case , put all remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl , season well with salt and pepper and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon , flour a board and lightly butter a 21 cm flan dish
 - With well-floured hands gather the meat mixture into a ball
 - Take just under two-thirds of it and press it out with your floured hands on to the board in a circular shape bigger than the flan dish
 - Line the flan dish with it , pushing it up the sides so that it extends slightly over the rim and spoon in the vegetable filling
 - Now make another flat circle with the remaining meat mixture , moisten the edges with little water and put it on top , press down the edge so that it overlaps a bit , as the meat will shrink slightly while cooking
 - Brush a little olive oil over the top
 - Bake the dish in the centre of the oven on a baking sheet for 1 hour
 - To serve just cut in slices , as with a pie
