description: >-
  This has the makings of a stir-fry with the convenience of throwing everything
  together. the veggies can be personalized to suit what is on hand or to cater
  to the likes and dislikes of the family. simi likes it sweet and garlicky
  whereas my husband doesn't like it very sweet at all so depending on who is
  eating determines how it is seasoned. serve over rice or lo mien noodles with
  some take-out egg rolls and fortune cookies for an easy chinese meal.
