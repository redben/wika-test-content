  Not only are these cutlets good to serve any day of the week but in my opinion
  they are just as good to serve for company.  i like them served with a simple
  saute of spinach, a side of rice or pasta and a nice glass of wine.  food just
  doesn't get any better!

 - With the smooth side of a meat mallet , pound chicken breasts between sheets of plastic wrap to a thickness of slightly over 1 / 4-inch
 - Cut each pounded breast in half in order to make regular size cutlets
 - If using large size chicken breasts , you may need to cut them into thirds
 - Place 4 fresh sage leaves on the under-side of each pounded chicken breast
 - Cover leaves with prosciutto
 - Pound very lightly with "toothy" side of meat mallet to help adhere sage leaves and prosciutto to breast
 - Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess , being careful not to dislodge prosciutto and sage
 - Place chicken on a large platter or cookie sheet
 - Place in refrigerator for 10 - 30 minutes
 - Meanwhile , chop remaining sage leaves for a total of 1 t , set aside
 - Place a heavy skillet over medium-high heat
 - Once skillet is hot , add enough olive oil and heat through
 - Saut chicken about 2 - 3 minutes per side or until golden and just cooked through
 - Remove chicken to a clean platter
 - Immediately top mozzarella on each cutlet while chicken is still hot
 - Sprinkle a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice on each cutlet
 - Cover immediately in order to help cheese melting process
 - Remove any excess olive oil in order to end up with at least 2 3 tablespoons oil remaining in skillet
 - Add marsala or port and white wine to hot skillet and let boil , scraping up browned bits , for 1 minute
 - Add stock to skillet and boil until reduced to 3 / 4 cup
 - Add chopped sage
 - Simmer 1 minute
 - Adjust seasoning with black pepper and salt if necessary
 - Pour sauce carefully to the side edge of platter , being careful not to pour quickly over chicken so as to keep mozzarella in tact
 - Fresh sage in this dish is a must , the dry will not be the same and will result in something different
