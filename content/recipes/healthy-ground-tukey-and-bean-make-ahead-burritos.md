title: Healthy Ground Tukey And Bean Make Ahead Burritos
date: 2010-02-17T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  This recipe for burritos is healthy because it uses lean ground turkey, whole
  wheat tortillas, brown rice, and reduced fat cheese. you only need 1/2 lb of
  beans to make this, but i always save myself some time and cook an entire 1lb,
  and freeze half. next time i make burritos, i won't have to cook the dry beans
  first!  vegetarian option: omit the ground turkey and use  an entire lb of dry
  beans to make your burritos.
