description: >-
  I purchased from world market a 16.5 oz. bottle of pumpkin spice syrup by
  torani with the inscription "authentic coffehouse flavor" for $5.99. 
  according to the ingredient list, it was basically caramel sauce with nutmeg. 
  that's it...caramel sauce and one spice with no pumpkin whatsoever and
  expensive.  though it was tasty, in order to get a good infusion of the spice,
  quite a bit needed to be added to each serving.  the recipe below is basic. 
  vanilla may be added and can imagine pumpkin puree or caramel sauce being a
  good addition, as well.
