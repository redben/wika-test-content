  I tried for a long time to find a chewy granola bar recipe that my kids
  enjoyed and that stayed moist. this is what i came up with! it is fairly
  healthy and you can mess with the additions to get what you want in a granola
  bar. i will often use sliced almonds instead of cranberries, or chocolate
  chips instead of raisins. the choices are endless!
