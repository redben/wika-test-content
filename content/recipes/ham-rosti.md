  I was cleaning out a canvas bag and found this recipe tucked inside it. i have
  no idea of where i got it, but am posting it, as it sounds like a good way to
  make use of leftover ham. the us measurements are not precise, but close
  enough for this kind of dish. use the converter if you want precision.
