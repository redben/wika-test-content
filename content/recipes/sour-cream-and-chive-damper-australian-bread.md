  Damper is a quick bread that is fabulous with a barbecue! damper was
  traditionally made in a cast-iron pot with a lid, called a "camp oven". the
  entire pot was either covered in hot wood coals or the camp oven was placed in
  a hole in the ground and surrounded with hot wood coals. it was usually served
  with tea made in a billy over the camp fire. damper was originally made with
  plain flour, salt and water. adding butter and self-raising flour came later
  on and gives a much tastier result. i got this recipe from taste, an
  australian website. enjoy!
