description: "I have discovered blue cheese dressing & dip  nirvana! i have yet to find a ready made that i like. i came up with this when serving buffalo chicken wings last week. why start from scratch when you can cheat?! :d  \r\n\r\nsuper simple and full of garlicy goodness  & blue cheese.  great as a salad dressing, raw veggie dip, buffalo chicken wings, etc. i have listed the full 12 ounce jar of marie's caesar dressing and 5 oz  container of blue cheese. use as much or as little of each ingredients as you like. the bottom line is, estimate how much you will need & make it to your liking. thin it with mayo & milk if you are looking for a thinner dressing. make it thicker ( dressing & blue cheese only) for dipping. serving size is arbitrary based on the ingredients amounts you decide to use."

 - Decide how much caesar dressing you will need
 - Add enough blue cheese crumbles to suit your taste
 - I like lots !
 - If your dressing is too thick , add milk to thin or mayonnaise to stretch the amount of dressing
 - Mix , check for seasoning & adding more blue cheese or creamy caesar
 - Add pepper to taste
 - Combine all ingredients , but don't smooth out the chunks of blue cheese
 - That would be criminal !
 - Serve and enjoy !
