  This was a recipe shown on "ten dollar meals".  looked to so simple but tasty,
  so posting for safe keeping.  i made this and liked it made the way it was but
  felt it could be a little more flavorful.  next time i am going to try using
  beef stock and add more seasoning to it while it is cooking.  definitely use
  several shallots and probably add more butter to saute them in the beginning.
