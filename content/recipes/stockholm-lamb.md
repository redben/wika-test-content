 - Cut off as much fat as possible so the flavours go straight into the meat
 - This is the longest bit
 - Skip the salt
 - I use as much prepared mustard , usually french or dijon and rub it in , as much as you feel like !
 - Rub in the mustard and garlic on all sides and pour over a little bit of the water , gently so you don't wash off the goodies already on it
 - The water also makes the lamb just moist enough to dampen the next super ingredient
 - Sprinkle over a couple of tablespoons of coffee granules
 - Skip the sugar and leave the brandy till a little later or you'll definitely lose all the alcohol
 - If cooking in the frypan pour more water into the frypan not on the lamb or you'll definitely lose all the goodies
 - Cook on 8 , for a couple of hours
 - Keep checking to make sure the pan does not boil dry and turning the lamb a few times to make the flavours go all through
 - You can add oil at the beginning if you like
 - I sometimes cook the veges in with the lamb and they come out black and yummy but not crunchy
 - Shanks don't take as long as the leg to cook and are better with a lower temperature about 160c in the oven , especially if you are just cooking the shanks
 - If cooking in the oven , i use less water 'cos it doesn't evaporate as much and bake uncovered at about 180-200c for a couple hours
