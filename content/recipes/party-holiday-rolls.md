 - I love homemade rolls but i hate to have to buy bread flour to make it
 - Now i have a recipe that uses regular all-purpose flour
 - I always put a little sugar in the yeast
 - I'm also very good about checking the expiration on the yeast
 - The yeast does work well with 1 tablespoon of sugar
 - It should froth right away in 15 minute or your yeast is too old
 - I keep mine in fridge
 - Keep only about 6 months without this test
 - It is called proofing
