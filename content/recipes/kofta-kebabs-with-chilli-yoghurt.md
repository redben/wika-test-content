description: "A simple weeknight supper solution that is quick, tasty, and fairly low in fat too!!\r\ni often make mine into little patties if i'm short on time, rather than mess about with skewers.\r\ni often use wholemeal pitta bread instead of tortillas too.\r\ndon't skip the chilli yoghurt...it reallly makes it!"
