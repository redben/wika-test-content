description: >-
  I used this recipe for week 32 of my food blog, "travel by stove." i am
  attempting to cook on meal from every nation on earth, and bolivia is my 32nd
  stop. unless otherwise noted, my travel by stove recipes are taken from
  authentic or traditional sources, and this recipe has been posted without any
  alternations or additions to the ingredients. this bolivian side dish is made
  with a fresh farmer's cheese; "kolla" (traditionally used) is saltier than
  queso fresco, so when making this be sure to taste and add salt according to
  your preferences.
