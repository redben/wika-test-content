  My husband's christmas party was catered by l'auberge du lac and this was the
  best dessert served out of many.  it has a strong hint of the liquor, and a
  gooey chocolate taste, almost like a perfectly undercooked brownie with the
  pecan bits inside.  absolutely delicious, it was a phenomenal hit, served at
  room temperature without topping.  i found the recipe posted on our local news
  site by the pastry chef who catered the event, bill foltz.
