 - Finely chop the garlic and mushroom and fry in olive oil with the rosemary over a medium heat for approx 20 minutes ensure to season the mushrooms well with salt
 - Create a pouch in each chicken breast with a sharp knife and fill with the mushroom stuffing
 - Wrap each breast in a slice of parma ham
 - Place in a roasting dish with plenty of olive oil
 - Cover with tinfoil and cook for approx 30 mins at 190 degrees
 - Can be served with salad , baked or mashed potatoes etc
 - My preference is mashed / whipped garlic potatoes with onion gravy on the side !
