description: "1  wheat beer  \r\n1  cola  \r\n\r\n\r\nthis is a popular mix drink especially with the younger folks in germany. \r\n\r\nit is vital that you use a tall glass for this and pour the beer slowly into the glass (while holding glass tilted to the side, adjusting the angle as the glass fills).\r\n\r\nthe drink is rather muddy looking but refreshing and appeals even to \"non beer fans\""
