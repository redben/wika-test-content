description: >-
  The reuben is the epitome of the great deli sandwiches... every ingredient is
  important as well as how it's prepared.  this is how we make our own reuben,
  and we've been told it's the best in the northwest.  it takes making your own
  ingredients in several cases, but we certainly feel it's worth the trip, as
  have our fans.
