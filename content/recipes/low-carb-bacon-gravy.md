  My family enjoys sausage gravy over biscuits from time to time, but not too
  long ago i decided to try it with bacon and it was a hit! i serve mine over
  toasted low carb bread or over cooked, semi-mashed cauliflower and either way,
  it's very good! for my non-low carb eaters, i serve it over biscuits and there
  are never any leftovers!
