description: >-
  I had a craving for burritos, and this is what i came up with.  for the taco
  seasoning, i used recipe #199955. for the shredded chicken, i started with 3
  pounds of bone in, skin on thighs, which i roasted with just salt and pepper.
  i have a small appetite, so one burrito is a serving for me, but if you have a
  larger appetite, two might be better.

 - Make the refried beans
 - In a medium dutch oven or heavy sauce pan , combine the pinto beans , diced onion , and 2 1 / 2 cups water
 - Bring to a boil , covered , then remove from heat and let soak , still covered , for 2 hours
 - After 2 hours , stir the beans and bring back to a boil
 - Reduce to a simmer , and let cook until the beans are very tender
 - This will take between two and three hours
 - Add the kosher salt
 - Taste the beans for seasoning , and if necessary , add the msg
 - Use a potato masher to crush some of the beans , and stir to thicken the liquid remaining in the pan
 - If you like your beans smoother , crush as many as makes you happy
 - Set beans aside
 - Chicken mixture
 - In a bowl large enough to hold all of the chicken , combine the water and taco seasoning
 - Add the chicken , and toss until all of the pieces are coated with the taco mixture
 - Taste a piece for seasoning , and if needed add salt or pepper to taste
 - Wrap the tortillas in plastic wrap and heat them in the microwave until they are pliable enough to wrap without breaking
 - Set one tortilla on a workspace
 - Add about two tablespoons of the refried beans
 - Top with about 1 teaspoon of queso fresco
 - Top with chicken mixture
 - Roll up the burrito and place on a serving platter
 - Repeat with the remaining ingredients
