 - For a version that is not quite so rich , you may omit the parmesan cheese
 - In a large saucepan , bring 1 quart of water to a boil
 - Add the salt and orzo and cook until the orzo is tender and has absorbed almost all of the cooking liquid , 8 to 9 minutes
 - Stir in the butter , parmesan cheese , lemon zest and juice and parsley
 - Serve immediately
