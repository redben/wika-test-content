description: >-
  Found in a booklet called no-fuss oven fare.  the only thing i change from the
  original recipe is i add brewed coffee in place of dry red wine. feel free to
  use what you would prefer or what is on hand in case you don't have leftover
  coffee.  this can also be prepared in a crock-pot.  i have entered those
  instructions too.

 - Heat oven to 350f
 - In a skillet , heat oil over medium heat and then brown the roast all over
 - This sears in the juices and releases some of the fat so you get a moister roast as an end result
 - In a small bowl mix together the beef broth , coffee , thyme , salt , pepper and garlic
 - Wait on preparing the carrots and potatoes till a bit later
 - Spray a dutch oven or large roasting pan lightly with non-stick cooking spray
 - Place roast in center of pan and pour broth mixture around the roast
 - Place the sliced onions around the roast
 - Cover and bake 2 1 / 2 hours
 - At about the 2 hour mark prepare and cut your vegetables
 - Add sliced carrots and potatoes to the sides of the roast
 - Cover and bake another 1-1 1 / 2 hours
 - Remove beef and vegetables from the roasting pan to a platter and keep warm
 - Skim fat from drippings left in the roasting pan and keep drippings warm
 - Whisk the flour and water together until smooth
 - Add at very small increments to the simmering drippings and whisk constantly to keep smooth and lump free
 - The key to this is not boiling the liquid but keeping at a nice simmer
 - Continue cooking 2-4 minutes until it is smooth and nicely blended
 - Remove from heat
 - Slice beef thinly and serve with the vegetables and gravy
 - Crockpot method:
 - Spray crock lightly
 - Place onions , carrots and potatoes in the bottom of the crock
 - Place roast on top of the vegetables
 - Pour broth mixture around the roast
 - Cover with lid and cook on low heat for 8-10 hours
