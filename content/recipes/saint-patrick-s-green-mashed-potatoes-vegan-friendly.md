  Found on the blog rhrecipes.com. psst-you could "sneak" in a small parsnip or
  two for added nutrition and the kiddos would never suspect. my two gold coins
  worth. no green dye was used in the preparation of this recipe-lucky you!
  please *note*: the food.com site is not working properly and i have been
  unable to add this ingredient to the list: 4 tablespoons sour cream (or
  substitute plain yogurt, creme fraiche, [soy] mayonnaise, cream cheese, etc.)
  a sprinkle of fresh or dried parsley either mixed into the potatoes or
  garnished on top would make a nice final touch and maintain the spirit of the
  green theme!
