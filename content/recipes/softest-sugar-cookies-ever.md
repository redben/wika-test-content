  Every time i make these, hubby takes a taste of the dough and declares “omg
  that is soooo good!!” so i guess as far as tasty cookie dough goes, this
  recipe is also a winner. although that’s to be expected of america’s test
  kitchen recipes. after all, they do spend a lot of time researching and
  testing recipe to find the perfect combination of flavor and balance.

 - Beat butter and rest of the sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy
 - Beat in the vanilla , then the eggs one at a time , until combined , only about 30 seconds
 - Reduce the speed to low and mix in the flour mixture until just combined
 - Chill the dough for about 30 minutes
 - Line cookie sheets with parchment
 - Using wet hands , roll 2 tablespoons of dough into balls , then roll in sugar to coat
 - Place balls on sheets , spaced about 2 inches apart
 - Very slightly flatten cookies with a flat surface
 - Bake cookies until edges are set and just barely beginning to brown but the centers are still soft and puffy , about 10-12 minutes
 - To keep these soft , you don't want to overbake them ! leave cookies on baking sheet after removing from oven for 10 minutes , then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely
