description: >-
  I found this recipe on the back of the country choice organic oven toasted
  oats container.  i followed all of the directions except i used a 9x13 in
  baking pan and added 1/8 cup of ground flax meal for extra fiber.  my kids
  couldn't tell the difference and loved it!  a very yummy source of whold grain
  fiber.  it states that you can substitute peaches or pears for the apples but
  the next time i am going to try comblining fruits.
