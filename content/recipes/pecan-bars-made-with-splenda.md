  I used the advice from the splendaÂ© website to make these pecan bars as
  diabetic friendly as possible without sacrificing taste or texture.  they were
  a huge hit both at home and at work and no one knew they were healthified! 
  this recipe calls for whole wheat flour which also adds a nice nutty flavor to
  the crust.  if you do not use whole wheat flour often, you can freeze it so it
  will keep longer.
