title: Mom S Salad Dressing Red Wine Vinegar
date: 2010-10-22T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  Simple and sweet, only three ingredients. to be clear, this is not an
  italian-style dressing.  this is a mild, sweet, natural-tasting dressing with
  no kick (that's how i like it).  still tastes good if you replace the sugar
  with truvia, though not so good with low-fat mayonnaise.
