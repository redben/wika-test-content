  Entered for safe-keeping. from simply classic by jr league of seattle. 
  elegant.  northwest u.s. cuisine. may use either fresh red bell peppers,
  roasted, or canned roasted red peppers.  note: reviews recommended use of
  reduced sodium chicken broth in lieu of regular chicken stock as the sauce
  seemed too salty.  likewise, i would also use unsalted butter.  i normally
  substitute the reduced sodium ingredients while cooking anyway out of force of
  habit.
