 - 1 preheat the oven to 350f
 - In a large bowl combine the sugar , eggs , and vanilla
 - Stir in the grated zucchini and then the melted butter
 - In a separate bowl , mix together the flour , baking soda , nutmeg , and cinnamon
 - Stir these dry ingredients into the zucchini mixture
 - Stir in walnuts , raisins or cranberries if using
 - 2 coat each muffin cup in your muffin pan with a little butter or vegetable oil spray
 - Use a spoon to distribute the muffin dough equally among the cups , filling the cups up completely
 - Bake on the middle rack until muffins are golden brown , and the top of the muffins bounce back when you press on them , about 25 to 30 minutes
 - Test with a long toothpick or a thin bamboo skewer to make sure the center of the muffins are done
 - Set on wire rack to cool for 5 minutes
 - Remove muffins from the tin let cool another 20 minutes
 - I got about 14 muffins from this batch , and that included filling the muffin cups up as far as they could possibly go
