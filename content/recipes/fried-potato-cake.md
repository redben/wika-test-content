  This is a recipe from a cookbook called "classic international recipes".  it
  is supposed to be one of the national dishes of switzerland and is often
  served daily.  it is often served with "veal with cream sauce".  the only
  thing i changed was to add some garlic (as usual).  please note:  this is
  supposed to make one big cake, that is then quartered to serve 4. chilling
  time is not included in the cooking time....i cook the potatoes in the
  morning, and prepare the cake in the evening.
