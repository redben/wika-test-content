description: "This was inspired by the thai iced tea that our thai restaurants serve. i don't usually post recipes that require such a specific ingredient but i'm hoping members will be inspired to try other flavors as well as what is posted.\r\nhttp://www.stashtea.com has this specific tea. they also have vanilla nut creme and creme caramel which i haven't tried but would probably be yummy!"

 - Steep for at least 5 minutes
 - It may taste bitter but don't be concerned
 - The sugar and milk will even it out
 - Remove teabags and add sugar
 - Stir until sugar is dissolved
 - To serve immediately: add ice to 4 cups
 - Divide tea among the cups and add 1 / 2 cup soymilk to each
 - To store: put tea concentrate into fridge
 - When ready to serve pour 1 / 2 cup of concentrate and 1 / 2 cup of soymilk into a cup and enjoy !
 - If you want to serve this as a dessert tea just try a decaf regular tea so that the whole beverage is decaf
 - Also if you use plain or unsweetend soymilk you will want to add more sugar
