title: Marinated Broccoli Slaw

description: >-
  Great change from mayo-based slaws!  i use a bag of pre-shredded broccoli slaw
  that includes shredded broccoli stalks, carrots, and red cabbage.  but i bet
  the marinade would be great for a cabbage slaw, too.  this gains flavor as it
  sits--best after a day in the refrigerator, but still good with a few hours to
  chill.  time does not include chilling.  i estimated six servings.  its
  probably several more than that, but *some* of us had rather large portions.
