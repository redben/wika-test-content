  I absolutely love this meal. simply prepared salmon with a glaze and roasted
  vegetables. can you say yum?! i found this recipe in an issue of better homes
  and gardens. side note: when i'm eating vegan, this is a great dinner to
  prepare so my family can enjoy the salmon and veggies, while i just eat the
  roasted veggies. i love that i don't have to make two separate dinners.
