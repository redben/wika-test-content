description: >-
  I spent a little over seven years in the maritimes and had the opportunity to
  participate in the blueberry harvest a couple of times.  one year i asked the
  farmer if he could pay me my wages for the day in blueberries.  he laughed and
  gave me a lifetime of berries to take home!  i shared the berries with friends
  and neighbours and followed the suggestion of a local maritimer.  she told me
  to boil the berries with water, nutmeg, sugar and cinnamon and top with my
  favourite dumpling recipe.  so i did!  pulled out grandma's 1932 cook purity
  book cookbook and made her recipe for dumplings.  i thoroughly enjoyed the
  combination!
