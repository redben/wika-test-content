description: >-
  A classic dish, but i cut back on the cola for my version and add beef broth,
  tomato sauce and add a few more vegetables for my taste. i am sure there are
  many versions, but i was asked to post my version - so here it is. six (6)-8
  hours and you have a great all in one meal. serve this with a good dinner roll
  and a small salad.

 - Roast -- this to me is an important step
 - Season the meat well with a mix of the flour , salt and pepper
 - Rub it in well on all sides of the meat
 - Then in a large pan add the oil and heat to medium high
 - Sear the meat on all sides until you get a nice crust and it begins to brown
 - Just a minute per side is all you need
 - This really helps the flavor in this dish
 - Then add your meat to the crock pot
 - Crockpot -- add all the vegetables around your roast
 - I like to put the carrots , parsnips towards the bottom , then the potatoes and mushrooms , and last , add the onions over the top of the roast
 - Sauce -- mix everything together in a small bowl and pour over the meat and vegetables
 - Turn your crockpot on low and cook 6-8 hours
 - Mine was tender in 6 , but it really depends on whether you have a round or oval pot , and the newer models tend to cook a bit hotter
 - So , you know your crockpot best
 - Before serving , check if you want to add any additional pepper and add in the fresh parsley
 - Serve -- remove the roast and vegetables and make sure to let the roast set 15 minutes before slicing
 - Serve with the gravy on the side
 - Enjoy !
