  I love this one!   i don't make if often though - because i always eat too
  much of it!   i always  use hershey's chocolate bars in this one.  my sister
  made this years ago for a family dinner, it was the best part of the meal. 
  this one doesn't need a frosting to dress it up - it's great just as is.
