  An easy and filling dish.  the overall aroma is sweet from the allspice but
  each bite is a perfect blend of flavors.  the original recipe was found on
  recipes4us.co.uk but i've altered it to suit my tastes.  i have also made this
  soup using leftover, unseasoned rice and sometimes subbing chicken broth for
  some or all of the water.  thanks to kumsie, i've deleted an unnecessary step
  from the directions to help clarify the use of the coriander (cilantro).  :)
