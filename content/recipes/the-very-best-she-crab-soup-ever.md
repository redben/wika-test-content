  I am from the south carolina lowcountry, and i have spent years experimenting
  and trying to re-create the fabulous creamy crab soup native to charleston. i
  have played with numerous recipes, and i am finally satisfied that i have
  stumbled upon the perfect concoction of she-crab bisque. more than likely, you
  will end up with a "he-crab" soup, as the crab roe is what makes it "she-crab"
  and it is almost impossible to get your hands on. if you ever find crab roe,
  savor every precious spoonful! still a bowl of heaven without it though!
