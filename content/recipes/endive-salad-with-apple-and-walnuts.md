  I got this from yelton manor b&b & the manor guest house. i don't know why
  they ask you to just wipe the endive but i believe that, in todays market
  situation, i'd go ahead and wash it just before serving.

 - Combine oil , onion , mustard , sugar in a salad bowl and whisk until thoroughly blended
 - Add apple and chill until needed
 - Just before serving , mix the ingredients again and then sprinkle with walnuts , cheese and pepper to taste
 - Arrange the leaves on a platter or plate and then "load" them with the mixture
 - The leaves of belgian endive are shaped like small , oblong scoops and are ideal for holding a bite of something as savory and scrumptious as this fruit , cheese and nut mixture
