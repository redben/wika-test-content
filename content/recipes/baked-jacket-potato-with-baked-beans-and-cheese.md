  This is such a simple, quick meal. it's a very british way to serve a baked
  potato! baked beans here are different than in the us so if you can get a
  british brand, the recipe would be more authentic. british beans are cooked in
  a tomato sauce with no bbq flavour. that said, i'm sure this would be yummy
  with bbq beans as well!

 - Preheat the oven to 350f or 180c
 - Bake the potatoes as per your personal preference- i bake them in the oven for about an hour , until the skins are firm and the centres are soft
 - You may like to smear with butter , sprinkle with salt and wrap in foil
 - Towards the end of the potatoes' cooking time , heat the baked beans in a pan on the stove , until hot
 - Remove the potatoes from the oven , cut into quarters without cutting the whole way through
 - Squeeze the outside of each quarter to "pucker up" the flesh
 - Pour the desired amount of baked beans over the potato and sprinkle with grated cheddar
 - Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste and serve !
