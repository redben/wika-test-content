 - Add the onions & cook for 5 minutes , stirring frequently , until they are soft & transparent but not brown
 - Add the rice & stir constantly for 2 to 3 minutes , or until the grains are coated with oil
 - Pour in the water , add the salt & a few grindings of pepper & bring to a boil over high heat
 - Reduce the heat to low , cover tightly , & simmer for about 15 minutes , or until the rice is tender & has absorbed all the liquid
 - In a small skillet , heat 1 tablespoon of the remaining olive oil & in it cook the pine nuts until they are a delicate brown
 - Add them to the rice , then stir in the currants
 - In a large pot , bring 2 quarts of water to a boil over high heat
 - Drop in the grape leaves and immediately turn off the heat
 - Let the leaves soak for 1 minute , then drain them in a sieve and plunge them into a bowl or pan of cold water to cool them quickly
 - Gently separate the leaves and spread them , dull sides up , on paper towels to drain
 - Layer the bottom of a heavy 2 to 3 quart casserole with 10 of the leaves
