  Recipe courtesy of top secret recipes.www.topsecretrecipes.com if you do not
  use the paste food coloring to recreate the color of the original cookie, be
  sure to change the amount of water added to the wafer cookies from 3
  tablespoons to 1/4 cup.  the food coloring gives the cookies the dark brown
  almost black color.  the coloring can be found with cake decorating supplies
  at art supply and craft stores.  if the dough seems tacky, you can work in as
  much as 1/4 cup of flour as you pat out and roll the dough.  use just enough
  flour to make the dough workable, but not tough.
