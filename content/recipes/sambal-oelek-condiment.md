 - Preparation:
 - Wash the chillies , then just remove the stalks , but not the seeds
 - Put the whole chillies into the jar of a blender , add about 1 / 2 tablespoon of vinegar then blend
 - (warning , don't lift the lid straight off the blender jar and look in - you could get a major hit of chilli fumes !
 - Let it settle before opening the lid , carefully
 - ) if the chilli paste is too thick and chunky , add a little more vinegar , then blend again: it should become a smooth paste
 - Then stir in the salt
 - Keep the finished chilli paste in a sterilised jar in the fridge , ready to use whenever chillies are needed in a recipe
 - This is an indonesian style chilli paste , a great way to keep excess chillies you've harvested
 - It's adapted from 'the complete asian cookbook' by charmaine solomon
