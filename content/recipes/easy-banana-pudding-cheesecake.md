 - Preheat oven to 300 degrees
 - Cream together cream cheese and sugar until smooth
 - Add in eggs and mix until combined
 - In a separate bowl , mash up bananas
 - Squeeze in the juice from the lemon and stir until combined
 - Add the instant pudding and the mashed bananas to the cream cheese mixture
 - Make sure you scrap down the sides of the bowl often
 - Mix until combined
 - Batter will be thick
 - Put vanilla wafers into ziploc bag and crush
 - You want to leave some of them chunky so that you'll see bits of wafer in the cheesecake
 - Gently fold the wafers into the cheesecake batter
 - Spread batter in to graham cracker crust
 - Bake in the oven for about 55-60 minutes
 - It'll be a pit puffy when you first take it out of the oven
 - Don't worry , it'll all settle down as it cools
 - Allow cheesecake to cool for several hours in the fridge before serving
 - A great way to serve this is to top each slice with whipped cream and a slice of banana and vanilla wafer
 - Enjoy !
