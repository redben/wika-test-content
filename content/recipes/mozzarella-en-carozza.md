 - Season with salt , to taste , and reserve
 - Divide the mozzarella between 4 slices of the white bread
 - Put the remaining slices of bread on top of the mozzarella and press to close

 - Heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees f
 - Dredge each sandwich in flour and shake off the excess
 - Dip each sandwich generously in the egg / and cheese mixture
 - Work in batches , do this process to each sandwich just before frying , it's not a good idea to flour and dip ahead of time
 - Secure each sandwich with toothpicks
 - Put the first sandwich in the hot oil
 - Remove the toothpicks to turn and insert the toothpicks in the second side
 - When each sandwich is nice and brown on both sides , remove it from the oil and blot it on paper towels
 - Put it on a sheet tray with a rack and keep warm in the preheated oven
 - Repeat this process with each of the sandwiches
 - Cut the sandwiches diagonally into quarters , arrange on a serving platter and serve with the sauce
 - Sauce:
 - In a small saute pan combine the olive oil , garlic and crushed red pepper
 - Cook over medium heat until the garlic is golden brown and very aromatic
 - Add the lemon juice and capers and shake to combine
 - Swirl in the butter and season with salt , to taste
 - Toss in the parsley and serve immediately
