  This is not a simple recipe but it's worth it!  it's from the cookbook,
  "kaffeehaus: exquisite desserts from the classic caf√©s of vienna, budapest,
  and prague" by rick rodgers.  it is composed of six thin, nut meringue layers
  made with a mixture of ground hazelnuts and almonds (you can also use just
  almonds or just hazelnuts).  the layers are filled with a kirsch buttercream
  and the top layer is covered with an apricot glaze and is then covered with a
  faux fondant icing which is feathered with melted dark chocolate (it looks
  like a napolean).  you can make this 2 days ahead, cover and refrigerate.
