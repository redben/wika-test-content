  If you've ever been to benihana you will know that one of the highlights is
  the chicken rice they serve.  it is tasty and served right after their onion
  soup. i enjoy eating 1/2 the rice as an appetizer while waiting for my food to
  be cooked. i have read several recipes and have found an ingredient that makes
  this recipe more authentic. hope you enjoy.

 - The rice could be pre-cooked the night before and stored in fridge or cook the rice using package directions --
 - For this recipe you would use 4 cups of water and 2 cups of uncooked rice , pinch of salt and once you bring it to a boil , turn the heat down and cook for 20 minutes covered
 - You must spread the rice out after it is cooked in a shallow pan and cool it off in the fridge
 - Needs to be at room temperature or cooler
 - Make your garlic and butter compound
 - Put softened butter in a bowl large enough to allow you to mix the garlic into the butter
 - Needs to be well blended
 - Use a potato masher to mash the butter or use a hand mixer if you wish
 - Peel garlic by hitting each clove with the side of a knife being careful and keep sharp end of knife away from you
 - It is now easy to peel and you will do this with both cloves and then finely mince
 - After garlic is minced you will use the side of the knife and run the side of the blade in each direction to mash the garlic
 - You want to make a paste out of the garlic
 - Add the garlic to the butter and mix really well
 - Keep the bowl on the counter ready for use
 - Wash and dry your chicken breast and cube it into small bite size pieces
 - Dice your onion
 - Thinly cut the greens on the green onion
 - Scramble the eggs in a frying pan with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil
 - Then cut the cooked eggs into small pieces and put aside
 - In a large frying pan or a wok add 2 tablespoons of sesame oil and cook the onion on medium heat for 5 minutes stirring often
 - You just want it soft and don't burn it
 - Now add your cubed chicken and stir often
 - You don't want to burn the chicken but a little color is fine
 - Add some salt and pepper to taste
 - Cook chicken about 5-7 minutes on medium heat
 - It will cook fast because it is cubed small
 - Add 1 tablespoon of the garlic butter compound
 - Add the peas , carrots , and green onions
 - Cook for 5 minutes or until just tender
 - Do not overcook
 - Stir often
 - Leave in pan
 - Add 2 tablespoons of garlic butter compound and add the rice a handful at a time
 - Carefully stir everything together and keep adding rice until all the rice is added and well mixed together
 - At this time add 1 more tablespoons of the garlic butter compound
 - Cook rice for 5-7 minutes stirring often
 - Add the cooked eggs , stir well carefully
 - Now add your soy sauce
 - Mix well to distribute evenly
 - Add remaining salt and pepper to taste
 - If you wish to add the toasted sesame seeds do so now and stir and serve
 - Since we used sesame oil in the recipe the seeds are optional
