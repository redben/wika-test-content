description: >-
  This recipe came from an internet blog called showfood chef and was created by
  chef cathy shambley. i have changed it ever so slightly (almost not at all!)
  and it is really fantastic! the butter will help reduce foaming - don't add
  more than 1/2 teaspoon because that could raise the ph too much for safe
  canning. the lemon juice should be bottled because fresh lemon juice varies in
  acidity while bottled provides consistent acidity.

 - Prepare kiwi and peppers
 - I dice the kiwi and then mash it lightly with a potato masher and i use the mini workbowl of my food processor to mince the peppers - you can choose whether or not to seed them !
 - Combine kiwi , peppers , sugar , lemon juice and vinegar in a large stockpot , mix well and let sit , covered for 30 minutes
 - Heat the mixture over low heat , stirring constantly until all of the sugar is dissolved
 - Add butter , increase the heat to medium high and bring to a rolling boil
 - Boil hard for 6 minutes , stirring frequently
 - Add the pectin all at once and stir to dissolve
 - Return to a full rolling boil and boil hard for 1 minute , stirring constantly
 - Remove from heat and stir constantly for 3 minutes to help redistribute the fruit evenly in the jam and prevent it from floating to the top of the finished product
 - Ladle jam into hot jars , leaving 1 / 4 inch headspace
 - Process jars for 10 minutes in a boiling water bath - adjusting processing time for altitude
