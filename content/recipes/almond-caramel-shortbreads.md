  I don't really know where i got this recipe from, but i've had it hanging
  around for a while. these are so yummy, my boyfriend asks for them at least
  once a week. perfect for a holiday dinner, cookie exchange, or any other party
  where you want to dazzle your friends/make them love you forever. i sprinkle
  the top of this with sea salt before i pop it in the oven, i think it adds
  that little extra something. i've also drizzled it with melted chocolate after
  they've cooled, but their so rich you really don't need it!

 - For the shortbread:
 - Preheat your oven to 350
 - Prepare a 9" x 13" pan with either flour and butter , or a piece of parchment paper pressed into the pan and up the sides slightly
 - Cream your butter and sugar together
 - Scrape the bowl and add yolks
 - Scrape the bowl again , making sure the yolks are mixed in , but don't over mix
 - Add your spices and one cup of flour , mix briefly until just combined , then add your second cup of flour
 - Your dough should be moist and clumpy , dump this into your pan and press to fit in an even layer , with your finger
 - This doesn't have to be perfect
 - Bake for 15-20 min , until just set and lightly browned at edges
 - Prep your ingredience for the caramel as you put the shortbread in the oven
 - Put everything except the almonds into a heavy bottomed sauce pan
 - When you pull the short bread out of the oven , turn the burner on medium , and heat until the mixture is bubbly and starting to brown , stirring fairly constantly
 - Using a heat resistant spatula is great , so you can scrape along the bottom to prevent burning
 - This will take 5 min or so from everything melting
 - Turn off the heat and stir in your almonds until evenly coated
 - Spread the whole mixture on top of the shortbread and pop it back into the oven for another 15 to 20 minute
 - The mix will bubble in the oven , its done when the caramel starts to turn golden and the almonds at the edges start to toast
 - Let this cool for 20-30 min , then cut with a bench knife or a chefs knife
 - I like to cut them into triangles , but like brownies , you can go for whatever floats your boat on this end !
