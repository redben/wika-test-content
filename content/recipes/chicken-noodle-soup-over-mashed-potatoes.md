  If you haven't tried chicken noodle soup over mashed potatoes, i am sorry! 
  you will never go back.  it makes a creamy, delicious meal. i always make my
  recipe #407601 they really make a difference in the soup, 1 1/2 this recipe as
  you need more noodles.  i also use recipe#404067 for the potatoes, cut back a
  bit on the butter and milk when using in soup because all the liquid already
  gives it great flavor. enjoy!
