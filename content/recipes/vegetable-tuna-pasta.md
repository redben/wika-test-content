  Quick and easy to make, and healthy too. when it comes to these kinds of
  recipes, i like and enjoy the contrast of colours, because we, of ocurse, eat
  with our eyes first. cooking time will include the cooking of the pasta, even
  though it has already been cooked by the time you go through the steps of the
  directions, below.
