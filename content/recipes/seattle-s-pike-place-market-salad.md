  I've seen this recipe on several websites, but this one is from the health.com
  website.  the ingredients are largely from fresh pacific nw produce from the
  pike place market.  most people associate pike place market with its brief
  spot in the limelight in the tom hanks/meg ryan movie "sleepless in seattle"
  that was filmed in seattle, or for the entertaining "fish tossers" at the
  fresh fish stand.  but it's so much more than that.  pike place market is
  truly a must-see for anyone visiting seattle with stand after stand of fresh
  fish caught in the pacific northwest waters, locally grown fresh produce, and
  a plethora of intriguing and quaint boutiques selling local artisan's crafts
  and wares.  be sure to visit the pike place market whenever you make a stop in
  seattle.  note:  the recipe calls for pre-bagged herb salad mix.  if you
  cannot find it at a your local market, just use any combination of lettuces
  and herbs.
