description: >-
  There is something so very comforting about roasting a chicken. not just the
  wonderful savory aromas and flavors, but the whole process of prepping the
  vegetables, rinsing the beautiful little chicken, trussing it, tucking its
  wings under, mincing the rosemary and the garlic--the whole process is so
  centering and kind of zen.  this recipe is based on one that i found on
  saveur.com.  however, i vary it so much that what is here is more my recipe.
  but that is the art of cooking, changing it around, quoting emeril, "kicking
  it up a notch," to make it our own.  i love a small organic chicken, under 4
  pounds, but then some people prefer a larger one for roasting.  the beauty of
  this recipe is that you can use any type of root vegetables you have on
  hand.and instead of the mild red chiles i prefer, you can use bell peppers.
  also any type of winter squash, but for something different, try a kobacha
  squash, as the saveur recipe uses.the saveur recipe also uses celery hearts
  instead of fennel.

 - Cut chilies in half lengthwise , removing core and seeds
 - Reserve some of the veggie stalks and trimmings to use in stock
 - If using cippollini onions , blanch them , rinse under cold water and peel the outer papery layer and some of the base , leaving enough base to hold the little onion intact

 - Using a small saucepan , saute garlic in a small amount of olive oil
 - Then add 1 cup of the chicken stock and 1 sprig of rosemary and reduce to 1 / 2 cup

 - While chicken is roasting prepare the parsley butter sauce: add in juice of 1 / 2 lemon to 1 / 2 cup of chicken stock and continue to reduce until only 2--3 tablespoons remain
