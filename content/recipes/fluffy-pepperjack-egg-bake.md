  This wonderful egg recipe takes minutes to prepare and only 35 min to bake.
  when fresh out of the oven it's light and fluffy and makes a great meal to
  share with family. as leftovers, it's a fabulous quick meal in the microwave!
  this recipe makes two 9x13 pans of eggs to be warned that it makes a lot. but
  it's addicting!
