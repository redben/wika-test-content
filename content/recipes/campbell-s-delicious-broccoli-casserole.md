  Last thanksgiving we were invited to one of our friends house for dinner. i
  had this broccoli casserole there and i fell in love with it immediately. then
  i tried some other broccoli casserole recipes that i found here and elsewhere
  on the internet. none of them tasted like my friend's casserole. finally i
  called her and asked the recipe and she told me that she got it from the
  campbell's kitchen. i wanted to share this recipe with everyone who is looking
  for a simple and extraordinarily delicious broccoli casserole recipe:-) my
  husband and i just loved it!!!enjoy...
