description: >-
  This recipe comes from west africa, and is from classic international
  recipes.  because rivers, lakes, and ocean inlets are plentiful here, fish and
  seafood are used often. it is too "bland" as posted, so i have taken some
  liberties! maybe not authentic, but tastier! revised 06/03/2011.
