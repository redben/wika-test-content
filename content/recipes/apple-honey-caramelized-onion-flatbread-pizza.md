 - First , the long part requiring patience: make the caramelized onions for your pizza
 - Heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the onions , rosemary , salt , and pepper
 - Stir to combine thoroughly
 - Cook over medium until the onions become translucent
 - Then turn down the heat and cook slowly , stirring frequently , until golden and irresistibly fragrant
 - Remove from heat
 - That was the hard part !
 - Preheat your oven to 450 degrees
 - Assemble your pizza: spray your your pan / stone lightly with cooking oil , then sprinkle it scantly with the cornmeal
 - Spread your prepared pizza dough over this in a circle
 - Top this with your caramelized onions
 - Next arrange the apple slices--i did a mix of finely sliced "honey crisp" and "granny smith" apple , using just a bit less than one apple total
 - Top the apple layer with the cheeses: first the brie , then just a bit of mozzarella , then the parmesan
 - Drizzle the pizza lightly with a good honey
 - Then sprinkle artistically with parsley because you've now committed to this strange pizza
 - Cook this in the preheated oven for 15-25 minutes , or until the crust is slightly crisp and the cheeses begin to turn golden-brown
 - Enjoy !
