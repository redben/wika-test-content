  This waffle recipe is very easy to put together. i make it in my food
  processor but i'm sure you can also make it in a large blender. the recipe can
  be kept up to a week in the refrigerator. very easy to make it for my family
  in the mornings before we all rush off to work and school. just pull out the
  mix from the refrigerator and cook in the waffle maker. be careful, it's very
  addicting!
