 - File powder is a seasoning made from the ground , dried leaves of the sassafras tree
 - It's an integral part of creole cooking , and is used to thicken and flavor gumbos and other creole dishes
 - File should be stirred into a dish after it's removed from the heat because undue cooking makes file tough and stringy
