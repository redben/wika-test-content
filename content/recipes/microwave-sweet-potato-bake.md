description: >-
  This is a dish my mother created. it is so easy, fast and always gets rave
  reviews from dinner guests! it is my favourite side-dish. it goes really well
  with fish or any other white meat. i have always made this by eye, so the
  measurements are a rough estimate. (preperation time excludes steaming of the
  sweet potatoes.)

 - Thickly slice the sweet potato , and place a layer into a round 9" microwave-safe dish
 - Slice the bananas and place the banana slices over the gaps left by the potato
 - Sprinkle the banana and sweet potato with a layer of gingernut crumbs
 - Sprinkle generously with some of the brown sugar
 - Continue to build layers , finishing with gingernuts and sugar
 - Pour enough evaporated milk over the dish to fill all the gaps
 - Last layer of potato should still be visible above the milk
 - Place into the microwave and cook on high for 5-7 minutes
 - Let stand for 2 minutes before serving
 - Variation: add some mini marshmallows for variation
 - The dish is sweet enough without them , so reduce sugar if you choose to do so
