description: "Posted for zwt8.  i love custards of any kind and this one sounds good with the chili powder - not to mention lighter with the sugar substitutes.  now just need to try it out.\r\n11-27-2012:  finally got around to making this and it's pretty easy and we enjoyed the taste - however; to get it to set i did have to cook it longer than the time listed, almost double but that might have been my oven that i'm having trouble with right now.  but the end result was so worth it to us."
