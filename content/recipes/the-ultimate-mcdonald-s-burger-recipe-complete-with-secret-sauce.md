 - Sauce:
 - Mix all ingredients and then microwave for approximately 20 seconds on high to melt sugar
 - Then refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving , allowing flavors to blend
 - This is the most crucial yet overlooked step !
 - While waiting on sauce , gather burger ingredients
 - Pickles: slice vlasic original or heinz genuine dills into small slices and set aside
 - Onions: place dried onions in tupperware container and cover in water set aside
 - Patties: mix salt , msg , pepper , and onion together in a shaker or small container
 - Lightly season beef , kneading about 1 / 3 of the seasoning into the meat
 - Divide meat into 8 small patties about 4 in by 1 / 4 in for 1 / 8 lb patties , 1 / 2 - 3 / 4 in for 1 / 4 pound patties
 - Press flat onto wax paper and then freeze for approximately 30 minutes
 - Once frozen , cook patties at about 400 degrees on a griddle , george forman grill , or if necessary , pan fry them on high
 - They are thin , so they should cook quickly , about 2 minutes each will do
 - Sprinkle generously with premade burger seasonings , remove and top with 1 slice of kraft american cheese
 - Then open and place both crown and heel of burger bun on same griddle , allowing bun to toast and soak in burger flavor
 - Make sure that griddle is not wet enough to dampen bun ! you want to allow bun to pick up residual burger flavors , without soaking or dampening
 - Toast for approximately 1-2 minutes
 - Remove bun and seperate two pieces , crown and heel
 - Crown: top with 5 small squirts of heinz tomato ketchup , 5 squirts of yellow french's mustard , and then add your onions and pickle slices
 - Heel: top generously with mac sauce before topping with patty and prepared crown
 - "big mac style:" if desired , this recipe can be used for larger 1 / 4 lb patties and / or layered "big mac" style
 - If this is desired , toast two buns per burger , discarding second crown on each
 - Top each heel with mac sauce , burger patty , and 1 slice kraft american cheese , then stack one on top of the other
 - Prepare one crown as described above and then top burger with onions , pickle , toasted crown , and any additional desired ingredients
 - And presto ! the ultimate mcdonalds style cheeseburger ! this recipe can be made very quickly with practice
 - Additionally , making sauce and patties in advance really speeds up the process
 - Your thoughts are always welcome and appreciated , enjoy !
