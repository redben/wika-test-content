  outcome is spectacular!

 - Place the garlic and ginger in a food processor fitted with a steel blade
 - Add the vegetable oil , tahini , peanut butter , soy sauce , sherry , sherry vinegar , honey , chili oil , sesame oil , and ground peppers
 - Puree until smooth
 - Rinse and drain the kelp noodles in a colander , place it in a large bowl , toss with 3 / 4 of the sauce
 - Add the red and yellow bell peppers and scallions
 - Toss well
 - Serve warm , cold or room temperature
 - The remaining sauce may be added , as needed , to moisten the pasta
 - I love adding some crunch , so i usually throw some chopped peanuts , or blanched broccoli bits , crumbled crisp onions - anything really !
 - If you're not into spice , reduce it - although i personally feel that the spice adds another layer of amazingness ! =)
