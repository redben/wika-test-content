  I love lasagna!  pretty much any kind of lasagna, too!  you know what i don't
  like?  bland, flavorless lasagna.  whenever i try a frozen lasagna from the
  store - i think "who likes this?  it has no flavor!"  so... now i make my
  own.  this is just one version of many that i like to make.  try it!

 - Preheat your oven to 350
 - Lightly grease or spray a 13x9 baking pan
 - Start by sauteing your mirepoix veggies in a little oil over medium high heat - about 5 minutes
 - Add your hamburger and cook until well browned
 - Add your favorite jar of pasta sauce and mix to combine
 - Set aside
 - In a small bowl , add egg , all your spices , the cottage cheese , the parmesan and half of your mozzarella cheese
 - Stir to combine
 - Can you use ricotta instead of the cottage cheese ? yes ! of course ! it's your kitchen ! i'm just using cottage cheese because i have some and it reminds me of how my mom used to make lasagna
 - You do what you want !
 - Now - take a big scoop of sauce and slather it on the bottom of your baking pan
 - Layer 4 noodles across to cover the bottom
 - Take half of your cheesy mixture and spread all over the noodles -- try to cover it evenly
 - Now add half of your sauce mixture
 - Now more noodles
 - Then other half of your cheese mixture
 - Another layer of noodles
 - Now the rest of the sauce
 - And finally top with your remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese ! doesn't it look and smell good already ? !
 - Cover with a piece of tin foil bake for 45 minutes
 - After 45 minutes -- visit your lasagna and take off the tin foil
 - Yum , right ? let it cook 15 minutes more
 - Now the hard part -- take the delicious lasagna out of the oven and let it rest for 20 minutes ! what ? ! you wanted to eat it right away ? ! me , too - but too bad -- it needs to rest ! if you want a soupy , runny mess of hot lasagna -- then go ahead and eat it right away
 - But if you want a beautiful , photo-worthy cut piece of lasagna that is pinterest worthy -- just wait
 - Sit down and have some wine -- make a salad -- or garlic bread !
 - This feeds 6 big eater , s or 8 regular eaters , or 12 small eaters
 - Ok - that's it ! enjoy your lasagna !
