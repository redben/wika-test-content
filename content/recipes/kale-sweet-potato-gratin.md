  This decadent recipe is from saveur.com, and is among the best i've found on
  their site.  it's definitely a calorie bomb, so i'll only make it for holidays
  or special occasions.  you'll never want to add sugar to a sweet potato dish
  ever again, as the cheesy, savory flavors pair perfectly with the natural
  sweetness of sweet potatoes.  it almost tastes like pizza, and while it's
  great as a side dish, i think it would make a great vegetarian entree.
