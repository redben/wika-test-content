  My mother, mrs. shashibala ramchandani, passed away in her sleep at 9pm due to
  a massive cardiac arrest here at our residence in pune on the 19th of april,
  just 2 days after my birthday. she was the best woman in this world and she
  made me feel strong and capable of doing anything i wanted. in the last few
  days that were left of her life, she enjoyed eating these rotis for breakfast
  alongwith a hot cup of tea on the side. i am posting this recipe today and i
  sincerely hope all my friends will try it and give me their reviews. also, for
  those zaarites i don't know, i would be so happy if you'd give this a try and
  get back to me through a review on how you liked it. a maid working for my
  home and looking after my mom taught me to make this roti.
