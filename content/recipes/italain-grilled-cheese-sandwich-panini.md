  Mmmm... mozzarella! try this grilled cheese sandwich with the italian twist!
  if  you haven't tried it before, pesto is one of the best condiments to use on
  a hot sandwich. instead of cooking the sandwiches in a skillet, you can use
  your panini press just as easily. this recipe is from a canadian cheese
  magazine. enjoy!
