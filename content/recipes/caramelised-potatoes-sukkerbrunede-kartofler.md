  A recipe i found online at denmark.dk for their christmas recipes.  these
  potatoes sound so different from what i have had and so tasty.  posting this
  for zwt 6.  i haven't tried them yet, but would taste them and then determine
  if they needed any salt or pepper.

 - Peel and dice potatoes then add them to a large sauce pan and cover with cold water
 - Bring water to a boil on high heat then reduce to a slow boil for 15 minutes
 - Rinse the potatoes in cold water and drip dry
 - Melt the sugar in a frying pan until golden
 - Add the butter and put the potatoes in the mixture when the butter has stopped fizzing
 - Brown the potatoes over a brisk fire while stirring
 - Caramelised potatoes are not suitable for re-heating , for then they will not become shiny , but dull and furry
