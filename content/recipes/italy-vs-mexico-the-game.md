 - To each tortilla , place 2 tbsp ricotta in the center and spread in a line out to about 2" from the edges
 - Sprinkle the top of the ricotta with 2 tbsp of mozzarella
 - Fold burrito style (fold large side over filling , fold short ends in , then fold over longways onto the tortilla
 - Try to keep it flat rather than fat so that the cheese will melt thoroughly
 - To a skillet or saute' pan , heat the butter and olive oil over medium to med-high heat
 - Watch carefully so as not to burn the butter
 - Sprinkle a pinch of salt into the pan and then place burritos into the pan
 - Cover and let simmer until golden brown on the underside
 - About 2-3 minutes
 - Carefully turn the burritos over and cook the other side 'uncovered' to a nice golden brown and crispiness
 - Cut each in half and place onto individual plates
 - Mix equal parts of salsa & pizza sauce together , place into dipping dishes and serve
 - Have fun dipping and tasting , and deciding which country wins !
