  Is stockpiling fruit and vegetables really necessary?  is it worth the time
  and trouble?  yes. and yes.  raspberries were on sale at my kroger.  (yes, it
  is mine!) for $0.99/pint.  those tiny little things are regularly $3.00 a
  pop.  i never buy them...somehow i can't justify spending $3.00 for 3 handfuls
  of delicious, sweet, succulent raspberries.  (i had forgotten how tasty they
  are!)  but, for just $0.99...i'll buy a pint.  or 12.  yep, 12.  what on earth
  are you going to do with 12 pints of raspberries that will start to go bad in
  2 or 3 days???  eat them, bake with them, and freeze them.  of course.  first
  we (the kids and i) ate 2 pints.  for a snack.  we like them that much.  then,
  i froze 8 pints.  cause i knew that we'd eat them if i didn't get them into
  the freezer.  right away!  i rinsed and let them drain for about 10 minutes. 
  then placed them on a paper towel to remove excess water.  then i neatly
  arranged them, gave into my type-a tendencies and placed them on a baking
  sheet.  popped them into the freezer for a few hours, then transferred frozen
  raspberries into freezer baggies.  i see mango raspberry smoothies in our
  future!  an antioxidant power punch of a smoothie!  mmmm...don't you want to
  reach through the screen and munch on a few?  finally for breakfast saturday
  morning, i made a raspberry coffee cake, following this taste of home recipe
  but making a few delicious modifications along the way.  i almost made
  raspberry baked oatmeal, but ended up trying this new recipe!
