 - Comgine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl
 - Stir well until the sugar has dissolved
 - Add four chicken breasts to the marinade , cover and chill for 2 hours
 - Don't let the chicken marinate for much more than that or it could get tough
 - While the chicken marinates , prepare the dipping sauce by combining the ingredients in a medium bowl
 - Stir well then cover and chill
 - This will allow all the flavors to develop
 - Combine pico de gallo ingredients
 - Cover and chill
 - To complete the fajita rollups , preheat grill to medium / high heat
 - Grill the chicken breast for 4 to 7 minutes per side or until done
 - Build each roll-up by first laying a large flour tortilla in a large skillet over low-heat
 - Sprinkle about 1 / 2 cup of the combined cheeses over the surface of the tortilla while it heats up in the pan
 - When the cheese begins to melt , remove the tortilla from the pan
 - Sprinkle about 1 cup of shredded lettuce in a strip across the center of the tortilla , followed by about 3 tablespoons of pico de gallo
 - Slice one grilled chicken breast into bite-size chunks and arrange the chicken on the lettuce
 - Fold the ends of the tortilla over the filling , then roll the tortilla from the bottom
 - Make a diagonal cut across the center of the roll-up and serve with a small dish of the mexi-ranch dipping sauce on the side
