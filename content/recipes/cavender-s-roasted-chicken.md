 - Pour chicken stock into roaster or whatever baking dish you are using
 - Liberally cover the chicken in cavender's greek seasoning
 - Place chick in the roaster / dish with the chicken broth
 - Cover the chicken with a lid or aluminum foil
 - Cook in the oven at 350 degrees f for 3 hours
 - 2 hours of cook-time is acceptable , but the meat will literally fall off the bone after 3
 - Enjoy !
