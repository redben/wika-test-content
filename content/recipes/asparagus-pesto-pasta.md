  I found this on the back of a tag for the majesty asparagus i had picked up at
  the market.  it was really enjoyable, and so easy to prepare, so i thought i
  ought to share!  i used my blender, so i roughly chopped some of the bigger
  ingredients (asparagus, pecans) before putting them in, but from what i have
  heard of the mightiness of the food processor, you might be good to go without
  doing so.  use your knowledge of your tools to decide how you want to approach
  it :)  i have also successfully served this over gluten free pasta (brown rice
  penne).
