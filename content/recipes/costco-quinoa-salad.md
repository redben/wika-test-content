description: "We love costco's quinoa salad so i was thrilled when i stumbled across the recipe in finecooking.com\r\nit's best to make this salad the day before you plan to serve it to give the grains time to absorb the vinaigrette and to let the flavors blend.  take it out of the fridge 30 to 45 minutes before serving for the best flavor."
