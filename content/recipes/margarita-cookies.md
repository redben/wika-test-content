  This comes from the cookbook "1 dough, 100 cookies" by linda doeser and has
  become one of my favorites.  it is a fairly basic recipe but the frosting
  really brings it to a whole new level.  i used regular sugar instead of
  superfine sugar and sauza tequila (not a white variety) that i happened to
  have in my pantry.  i am not a tequila connoisseur but this seemed to work out
  just fine.  enjoy!
