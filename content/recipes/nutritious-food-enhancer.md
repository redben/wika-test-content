 - Wash , peel , and cut food
 - Put raw food through a juicer , if you have one
 - If not , just move on to the next step
 - Put juice and pulp into a blender or food processor and process until it's smooth and moves freely or is pureed enough for your needs
 - Put the raw veggie puree into sterilized mason jars and freeze for up to 3 months
 - I use small jars , so i can take them out one at a time
 - Once thawed , they're good for a week
 - Put a little into just about anything: sauces , cereals , drinks , and spreads
 - Anyplace you can hide it will work !
