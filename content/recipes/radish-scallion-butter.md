description: "This arrived in my inbox from ivillage & was the only one of a bunch that i liked so i'm transferring it here.  i absolutely love the combination of scallions & radishes (see recipe#478892).  \r\n\r\n\"this is no “ladies who lunch” tea sandwich topper. this is a punchy, sock-in-the-mouth spread chock-full of spicy radishes and pungent scallions. smear it on crackers or toasted baguette slices for a zingy and quick appetizer.\"\r\n\r\ntremendously easy, tons of flavor & very versatile as a dip, spread on crackers or bread or toast points, a condiment (on a burger?)...let your imagination wander.  i think it would make wonderful tea sandwiches irregardless of the quote that came with the recipe.  maybe spread some into those early summer peas...."
