  I came up with these when i was staying at my good friend vicki's beach house
  on an inlet in washington. vicki may be known to you as food.com chef -
  lazyme! a beautiful location with a gourmet kitchen, i just had fun coming up
  with dishes at the last minute. keep in mind that the more oil you use, the
  crispier and tastier they will be. you can definitely keep them lower fat with
  less oil though! these would also be good as latkes, which can be a base for
  smoked salmon or other appetizers. enjoy!
