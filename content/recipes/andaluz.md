  According to "the art of spanish cooking" where i found this recipe, sherry
  does miraculous things to orange juice. in the usa, this drink is called a
  spanish screwdriver. in spain, a dry sherry would be used, but sweeter types
  are also good. any convenient proportions can be used, and a combination of
  orange juice and soda can be substituted for the juice.
