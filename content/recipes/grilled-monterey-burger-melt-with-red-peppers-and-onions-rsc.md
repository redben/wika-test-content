  Ready, set, cook!  reynolds wrap contest entry.  this is a sweet and spicy
  ground burger combined with the perfect creamy grilled cheese sandwich.  i
  started making this for my family on the weekends when we wanted more than a
  turkey sandwich for lunch.  it was a great way to combin our favorite grilled
  cheese and hamburger.  i added red peppers and onions to get some veggies into
  my kids and grilled the rye bread for the perfect sandwich crunch. if i know
  we have a busy weekend, i will prepare the ground beef, veggies and cheese
  sauce in the morning and refrigerate until lunch.  then i just reheat
  everything before assembling the sandwich.  it is a real time savor!
