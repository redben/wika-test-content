 - Place the flour , egg , and panko bread crumbs in 3 separate dishes
 - Dip the cheese cubes into each ingredient to coat , starting with the flour and ending with the panko
 - Preheat the canola oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees f , if you don't have a thermometer , a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes
 - Add the breaded cheese to the hot oil , in batches , and deep fry until the cubes are crisp and golden
 - Remove the cheese from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined baking sheet to absorb the excess oil
 - Transfer the cheese to a serving platter , drizzle with the honey , and dust with the paprika
