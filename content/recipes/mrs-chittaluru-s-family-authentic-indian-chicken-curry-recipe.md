  My friend's mom comes to visit him each year from india and is a super cook.
  this is an amazing recipe which, once you have the ingredients in your spice
  collection and have done it once or twice, it is a breeze to make.  most of
  these ingredients can be stored for a long time.  buy them if possible from an
  indian grocery store because they are usually cheaper and fresher than a
  supermarket.  i have wowed many guests with this dish and it is time that this
  recipe goes into the public domain.

 - Ginger / garlic paste: in a blender add peeled ginger and peeled garlic in equal parts and a little water and blend into a paste
 - You can also buy this in the indian market , but it is much better when made fresh
 - Meat prep: cut chicken into bite sized pieces
 - In a bowl , mix chicken , salt , pepper , turmeric , cayenne , cumin powder and coriander powder
 - Set aside
 - Cooking: use medium heat ! lower heat and longer cooking time gives the best results
 - In a deep wide pan heat oil till it's hot and add cloves , cardamom and cinnamon stick
 - Move it it around for several minutes
 - At this point , i remove the clove and cardamom because i hate biting into them later
 - Add onions and saute until they are soft and golden
 - Take your time on this as this is what makes the gravy creamy ,
 - Add ginger / garlic paste and lower the heat to medium low and cook for several minutes scraping the bottom often
 - If you have enough oil in the pan you will not have that much of a problem
 - Hey ! it's indian food , so oil is necessary evil :)
 - Add chicken mix from the bowl and cook till the chicken turns color
 - Add butter if desired
 - Keep stirring so that bottom is not sticking
 - This will take about 8-10 minutes or so
 - Add tomato and cook for another 2 minutes
 - Then add hot water to the pan till it barely covers the chicken
 - Cook on medium high till you see a lot of bubbling
 - Lower the heat to medium / low and cover the pan and let it cook for about 25-30 minutes , stirring occasionally
 - When done , you should have smooth dark brownish gravy that is not runny and the chicken should be tender
 - Eat it with hot rice
