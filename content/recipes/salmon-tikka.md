 - For the marinade: whisk the yogurt , cilantro , tomato paste , ginger , lemon juice , brown sugar , coriander , cumin , turmeric , cardamom , chili powder , garlic and salt and pepper together until well blended
 - For the skewers: thread the pieces of salmon and peppers onto the skewers , using 5 pieces of salmon for each skewer and 4 each of the peppers , alternating them so the peppers are between the pieces of salmon
 - Place them in a dish that will accommodate them in a single layer and pour over the marinade
 - Turn the skewers a few times , making sure they are well coated , cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 1 hour
 - Preheat an indoor grill or a barbeque grill to medium-high heat
 - Oil the grill , remove the skewers from the marinade and sprinkle them with salt
 - Place on the grill and cook about 5 minutes , turning halfway through cooking
 - Skewers are done when the fish is firm and slightly charred
