title: Japanese Style Chicken In A Pot Soup

description: >-
  Try to find fresh shiitake mushrooms or black chinese mushrooms for this, as
  they add a very distinctive flavor to the soup.  if you can't find them,
  substitute 2 oz of dried mushrooms that have been rehydrated according to the
  package directions.  this is a nice, light tasting chicken noodle soup.  a
  girlfriend that moved from california gave me this recipe....don't know where
  she got it.
