  This is a delicious recipe i got from my brother's father in law. i always get
  rave reviews when i make it! i don't like onions, so use dried minced onions-
  but don't serve right away so they can absorb the moisture.

 - Chop it all up and mix it together , let chill completely before serving
 - I find it tastes best served with frito's scoops chips
