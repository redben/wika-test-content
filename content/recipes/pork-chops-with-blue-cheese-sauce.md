description: >-
  This easy, flavorful recipe comes from the december/january 2010 "taste of
  home" magazine.  according to the recipe description, even those who do not
  like blue cheese will like this mild sauce.  dh hates blue cheese, but was
  willing to give this recipe a try.  he liked it.  we used a little more butter
  than the recipe indicated as we found we needed some more to give the roux a
  good consistency.   we also sprinkled our pork chops with salt and pepper,
  rather than just pepper.
