description: >-
  Six different kinds of cheeses, a pound of bacon, gooey deliciousness... it
  doesn't get much better than this. i stumbled upon this combination one night
  in college; rummaging through the refrigerator and cupboards to find something
  to cook, i found out that i had an ungodly amount of cheese, so i threw it all
  in et voila, the greatest mac 'n cheese i've ever tasted.
