description: "Chocolate and orange is one of my favourite combinations.  the chocolatey biscuit base of this tart is really easy and makes a great change from pastry.  when i bake this i use rita's lemon curd (stove top or microwave method) lime or orange curd and with having zest in the curd recipe, i leave that out of the tart recipe.  when mixing the ingredients, don't beat with an electric mixer, or too much air will be incorporated and the mixture will over-rise in the oven.\r\n\r\nread more: http://www.food.com/recipe/lemon-curd-stove-top-or-microwave-method-lime-or-orange-curd-61278#ixzz1fmca44vy"
