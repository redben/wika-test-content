 - Make tangzhong by wisking together the 25 g flour with the 125 ml of water in a small saucepan
 - Heat mixture over medium-low heat while stirring constantly until it thickens enough that your stirring leaves 'lines' or 'trails' on the surface , and then remove from heat immediately and scrape into a small bowl
 - Cover bowl with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying on the surface and cool to room temperature
 - Put milk , egg and cooled tangzhong in mixer bowl or bread machine pan
 - Add remaining ingredients except butter and turn on machine to begin mixing
 - Mix until ingredients just come together and then add butter
 - Knead until dough is smooth and elastic and will form a windowpane when stretched
 - Proof dough , covered , until it doubles
 - Deflate dough and divide into 4 equal portions , trying to make them as equal as possible
 - Cover and rest 15 minutes
 - Roll out each portion into an oval shape
 - Fold each side of the oval to the middle and roll again to flatten the seam
 - By hand , roll up each portion of folded dough starting at the unfolded end , so it resembles a swiss roll
 - Place all four rolls into a greased 9" x 5" bread pan with the ends of the rolls facing the long sides of the pan
 - Cover and proof until doubled
 - At this point you can apply an egg-wash by beating an egg and lightly brushing it over the top of the dough
 - Bake in preheated 350 degree f oven for about 30 minutes , until a deep golden brown
 - Remove from pan and cool on wire rack
 - If you didn't use an egg wash , you can brush tops of hot bread with melted butter if desired
