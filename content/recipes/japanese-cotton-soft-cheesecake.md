  This was posted on fb by a yvonne ruperti and looks so good.   there's a
  similar one on here, but this one uses sour cream and flour to help it rise
  and gives a texture that i enjoy.  similar to cheesecake but lighter version
  that's airy from the meringue folded in and not so sweet.  lemon juice and
  sour cream give it some traditional cheesecake appeal.   you will need an 8"
  spring form pan
