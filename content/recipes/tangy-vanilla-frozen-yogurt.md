  This yogurt is a salute to red mango. it isn't pretending to be ice cream. it
  tastes like tangy yogurt in frozen form. the result is creamy and completely
  refreshing without guilt. i opted for 2% to make sure the yogurt had the right
  consistency and didn't turn icy. i paired it with a slice of grilled pineapple
  and some homemade granola (recipe #424610 ) for a healthy sundae.
