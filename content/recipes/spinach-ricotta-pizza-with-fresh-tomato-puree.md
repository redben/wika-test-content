 - Divide dough into two and roll out into two thin crusts
 - Lightly brush olive oil to taste on top and bake the dough for 5 minutes in a 425 degree oven on a greased and floured pan
 - Meanwhile grate the four tomatoes into a medium bowl
 - If your tomatoes are really ripe , you can drain the excess liquid slighlty
 - Add the pressed garlic and olive oil
 - Add the spinach to a medium pan over medium heat and saute with salt and pepper to taste until half-wilted
 - Spread the tomato mixture on both crusts
 - Return to the oven for another 5 minutes
 - This should get rid of any excess liquid in the sauce
 - Top the pizzas with spinach , basil , and a light sprinkling of mozzarella
 - Finish by placing small dallops of ricotta around the pizza , using a small spoon
 - Bake for an additional 10 minutes or until cheese bubbles and begins to brown
