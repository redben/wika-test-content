 - You will need a baking stone or 2 jelly roll pans that fit side by side in the oven , plus a cookie sheet with no sides or a piece of stiff cardboard to slide the loaves into the oven
 - In the bowl of an electric mixer , stir together the flour and salt
 - In another bowl , whisk the yeast into the water
 - Then stir the yeast mixture into the flour
 - Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment and mix the dough for 1 minute on lowest speed
 - Stop the mixer and let the dough rest for 10 minutes
 - Beat the dough again on medium speed , until smooth and elastic , about 2 to 3 minutes
 - Oil a 3-quart bowl and scrape the dough into it
 - Turn the dough over so that the top is also oiled
 - Press plastic wrap against the surface of the dough and let the dough rise at room temperature until it is doubled in bulk , about 1 hour
 - About 30 minutes before you are ready to bake the dough , place the baking stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 500
 - If you are using pans instead of the stone , invert the two pans side by side on the middle rack of the oven and preheat at the same temperature
 - To form the loaves , scrape the dough onto a floured work surface , deflating it as little as possible
 - Gently pat the dough into an 8-inch square
 - Cut in half to make 2 rectangles
 - Sprinkle the cookie sheet or cardboard with cornmeal and arrange one of the pieces of dough at the far end , stretching the dough very slightly as you place it on the pan
 - Open the oven and slide the loaf onto the stone or one of the inverted jelly roll pans , quickly jerking away the cookie sheet or cardboard
 - Repeat with the remaining piece of dough
 - Bake until they are very dark golden and reach an internal temperature of about 200 degrees , about 25 minutes
 - Cool the breads directly on a rack
 - To serve: cut the loaf into thick vertical slices to serve it with a meal
 - To use the loaves for sandwiches , split them horizontally
