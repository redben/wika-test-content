  From my high school home economics book, i'd never heard of using cucumber in
  a cooked dish and my garden is going crazy at the moment with them so thought
  i'd give it a go. i think it's supposed to be a side dish but i think it's
  better as a sauce, i used it on top of some broccoli but i think it would be
  great with corned beef.
