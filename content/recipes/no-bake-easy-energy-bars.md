title: No Bake Easy Energy Bars
date: 2011-03-24T00:00:00.000Z
description: "Designed for hiking and backpacking trips, these bars are high in protein and clean carbs, do not require refrigeration, and travel very well in the pack.\r\n\r\ni recommend using non-pasteurized (living) honey, natural peanut butter with as little additives as possible, and quick oats."
