 - Heat oven to 350
 - Wrap bottom and sides of a 10-inch springform pan with a double layer of foil
 - In food processor grind crumbs , walnuts and brown sugar till fine
 - Add the melted butter till nicely blended
 - Press into the bottom of pan
 - Bake for 10 minutes
 - To prepare filling beat cream cheese on medium speed till smooth
 - Blend in the maple syrup
 - Add eggs , one at a time , blending well after each addition
 - Beat in vanilla , flour and cream until just blended
 - Do not overbeat
 - Pour into the baked crust
 - Set the springform pan in a large roasting pan and place on rack in center of oven
 - Pour boiling water into roasting pan until it is about halfway up the side of the springform pan
 - Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until set but still jiggly in the middle
 - I turn the oven off at this point and remove the cake from the roaster pan
 - I remove the roaster pan from the oven but leave the cake in there , with the door open , to cool
 - I've read that this helps prevent the cracking that sometimes happens while the cake cools
 - Refrigerate for at least 4 hours , covered
 - Carefully remove the sides of the pan
 - Drizzle with maple cream sauce and top with maple whipped cream
 - Garnish with some extra chopped walnuts , if desired
 - Maple whipped cream directions:
 - In a chilled bowl whip the cold whipping cream with the maple syrup till fluffy
 - Maple cream sauce directions:
 - Combine syrup , cream and butter in a medium saucepan
 - Stir to blend and bring to a boil
 - Reduce heat to medium low , continue boiling stirring occasionally for 5 minutes
 - This mixture can boil quite high so be very watchful of it and reduce heat a bit if necessary
 - Makes about 1 1 / 4 cups
