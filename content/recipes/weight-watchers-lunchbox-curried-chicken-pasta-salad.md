title: Weight Watchers Lunchbox Curried Chicken Pasta Salad

description: >-
  This is a very flavourful, flexible recipe. if serving immediately, i add baby
  plum tomatoes but these can make the dressing thin if it's being stored before
  serving. if you cannot find korma powder, just use 1tbsp + 1tsp curry powder.
  i use penne for this recipe- if you are counting propoints, it's probably best
  to weigh the pasta to 150g as it varies so much by volume. this serves 4 as a
  smaller lunch portion or 2-3 as a main dinner dish.
