description: "This recipe was posted on qdoba's website recently and i wanted to post it here.\r\n\r\nthis salsa is a sweet alternative to typical tomato-based salsas. the recipe is great year-round, although itâ€™s best when mangoes are in season each may. it pairs well with seafood, poultry, or simple tortilla chips."
