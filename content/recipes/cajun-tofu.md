title: Cajun Tofu

description: >-
  This was inspired by a recent trip to new orleans. i wanted something
  vegetarian, but with cajun taste & this is what i came up with.   it's easy
  enough for a weeknight dinner, but tastes like you've been cooking a while. 
  you can serve it over rice, pasta or, if you want to be really southern,
  grits.
