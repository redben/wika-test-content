description: >-
  Tej, or tejj, is an ethiopian sweet wine, similar to mead, that is typically
  made from fermented honey and a special kind of hops called gesho. it is
  traditionally served from a vase-like vessel called a berele. if you can't
  find tej or mead in your neighborhood, this recipe is a rough approximation. i
  tried this once at an ethiopian wedding and it's quite delicious! enjoy!
