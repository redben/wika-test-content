description: >-
  A delicious mixture of eggs, vegetables and sausage. this dish can be prepared
  for any time of day - we've enjoyed it for breakfast and for dinner, so it's
  probably just as satisfying for lunch! i have also presented this dish at
  employee gatherings and no matter how much i bring, it always disappears!

 - Preheat oven to 375 f
 - 9 pie pan , quiche dish or similar baking vessel at least 1 deep
 - Saut the chorizo links , in their wrappers , over medium-low heat
 - While the sausage is cooking , prepare the eggs , butter and water by whisking thoroughly then gently stir in the spinach leaves
 - If using shredded cheddar , measure the amount needed
 - If using packaged , block cheddar , slice the cheese into 1"x1 / 8" squares
 - Dice the tomato into 1 / 2"x1 / 2" pieces
 - Set these items aside until assembly time
 - Remove the chorizos from heat , cover the chorizo with a layer or two of paper towels and carefully pierce the casing releasing the rendered fat , squeezing gently , if necessary
 - When piercing the sausage casing , pierce the link in its side as the red oil rendered during sauting can squirt out unexpectedly
 - This is because a closed casing chorizo becomes pressurized during sauting , so the side-piercing is necessary
 - Take care the sausage and oil are very , very hot
 - Cut the remaining casing down the length of the sausage and scoop out the chorizo meat placing it on paper towels to absorb additional fat
 - Spray the baking dish with butter flavored or olive oil cooking spray , then pour in the beaten egg-spinach mixture
 - Evenly distribute the tomato and of the onion pieces throughout the eggs
 - Sprinkle the shredded cheddar or dot the cheddar cheese pieces across the top in a pleasing pattern , then sprinkle on the parmesan cheese and remaining onion
 - Lightly spray the top of the quiche with butter flavored or olive oil spray
 - Sprinkle a few grains of the seasoned salt and / or pepper over the quiche
 - Bake for 20 25 minutes or until cheese is a fantastic brown !
 - Remove the quiche from the oven and allow to rest about 5 minutes until completely set
