  Homemade graham crackers are actually easy!  here is a recipe from fran
  costigan from the best cookbook ever: vegan chocolate. seriously, buy that
  book. the recipes and photos are all outstanding.  this recipe doesn't call
  for graham flour, because not everyone has that in the cupboard, but toasting
  flour first has the same effect. it also calls for regular sugar to be ground
  in a blender until it becomes powdered sugar. that's because purchased
  powdered suger has corn starch in it and changes the texture. but i think you
  could probably cheat. if you are making these for crumbs, it makes about 2
  cups.
