 - Fry , then crumble the sausage
 - Add all ingredients except crumbled sausage and beef to a stockpot , bring to a boil
 - Add the beef a little at a time , so that the pieces don't stick together , and reduce to a medium simmer for about 1 hour or until beef cubes are almost tender , stirring every 15 minutes
 - Add crumbled sausage and reduce heat to a low simmer until beef cubes are tender , another to 1 hour , stirring every 15 minutes
 - The wheat bran flakes add no taste , but makes the chili thicker , and the fiber content is good for digestion
 - Most chili recipes use coarsely ground beef
 - This one uses inch cubes of beef , which would be like very , very coarsely ground beef
 - It gives the dish a unique heavier texture , and this recipe is a little soupier than most chili recipes
 - I now use a #22 meat grinder with a grinder plate that has 3 / 4 inch holes to grind the beef instead of spending the lengthy time to dice the beef into 1 / 4 inch cubes
