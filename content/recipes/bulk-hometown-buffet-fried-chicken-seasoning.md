  My reverse-engineered recipe for hometown buffet's 'hand breaded fried
  chicken' chicken yields enough seasoning for 6 batches fried chicken (for the
  single recipe version, see recipe #409958). mix 5 level tablespoons of this
  blend with 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour plus 1/4 cup cornstarch, for frying
  8-10 pieces chicken. see recipe #409958 for frying instructions.
