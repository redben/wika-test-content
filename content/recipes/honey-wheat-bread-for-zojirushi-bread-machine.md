 - Start by:
 - 1 , gathering and measure out all ingredients
 - 2 , warm the water to 105 degrees fahrenheit
 - 3 , warm the honey to 80 to 90 degrees fahrenheit
 - 4 , warm the butter to room temperature
 - 5 , mix the bread flour and the wheat flour together in a bowl before you add it to the bread pan
 - 6 , put the water and honey in the bread pan and add the flour making sure to cover all liquids by leveling off the flour with a rubber spatula
 - 7 , make a small well in the middle for the yeast making sure not to go to deep
 - 8 , add salt and 1 / 2 of the butter to one side of the bread pan on top of the flour
 - 9 , add dry milk and 1 / 2 of the butter to the other side of the bread pan on top of the flour
 - 10 , place the yeast into the well you made in the flour
 - 11 , now place the bread pan inside the bread machine and select the cooking cycle
 - 12 , you can use the quick bread cycle on your zojirushi bread machine , however i have found that the home made cycle below works better
 - Bread machine home made cycle setting:
 - 5min pre heat , 28 min kneading , 20min first rise , 40min second rise and 60min bake time
 - Bake on the light setting
 - Softer crust:
 - If you like a softer crust , once the bread is done , remove the bread pan from the bread machine and leave the bread in the bread pan cooling for 10 to 15 min depending on how soft you like your crust
 - The longer you leave it the softer it will be
 - Then remove the bread from the pan , place it on a cooling rack and continue to cool for another 15 to 20 min for a total of 30min of cooling , then slice and eat
 - For slicing i recommend using an electric knife
 - Even though the zojirushi bread machine will preheat the ingredients i have found it works best to warm some of the ingredients before you put them in the bread pan
 - Reminder:
 - You may need to adjust water or flour for your climate , i
 - E
 - , temperature , humidity and altitude !
