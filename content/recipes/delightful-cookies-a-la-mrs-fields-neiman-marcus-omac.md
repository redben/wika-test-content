description: "The mother of one of the kindergarteners on my bus run gave me a dozen of these cookies as a christmas gift one year. \r\nthey were such a hit at home that i asked her for the recipe. which she very graciously provided.\r\nnow it is my job to bake a batch every year for our family reunion christmas celebration.\r\nthese cookies are truly so scrumptious that there are never any leftover. \r\n(i use a cookie scoop, like an ice cream scoop, dipped in cold water before each use. individual cookie dough flash freezes very well. cook time is for one sheet in the oven - the rest of the dough is in the freezer!)"
