  I think i found this recipe in a glamour girl magazine in the 70s. it is
  family favorite at thanksgiving and christmas - rich, moist  and yummy! store
  in a covered container (if you have any left). i sometimes make smaller
  cookies and if so, the dough will make 6 dozen -- just adjust baking times
  accordingly.
