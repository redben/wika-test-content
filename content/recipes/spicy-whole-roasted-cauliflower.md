  By erin mcdowell, on purewow.com, january 23, 2014. i was skeptical at first,
  but we enjoyed the unusual combination of spices, it's sort of a vegetarian
  version of a tandoori dish. please note that the first word in the title is
  "spicy"; if your palate is not accustomed to strong, earthy spice blends, you
  might consider suggest finding an alternative marinade or cutting back on the
  amounts of spices for this technique, but if you like robust flavors go whole
  hog. in my experience, the cauliflower needed 10 or 15 extra minutes to cook,
  checking for doneness with a metal skewer, and the head i used was a small,
  organic one. we used the leftover marinade the following day on some broiled
  chicken.

 - Preheat the oven to 400 and lightly grease a small baking sheet with vegetable oil
 - Set aside
 - Trim the base of the cauliflower to remove any green leaves and the woody stem
 - In a medium bowl , combine the yogurt with the lime zest and juice , chile powder , cumin , garlic powder , curry powder , salt and pepper
 - Dunk the cauliflower into the bowl and use a brush or your hands to smear the marinade evenly over its surface
 - Place the cauliflower on the prepared baking sheet and roast until the surface is dry and lightly browned , 30 to 40 minutes
 - Test with a skewer to check interior doneness and cook longer if necessary , being careful not to scorch the marinade
 - The marinade will make a crust on the surface of the cauliflower
 - Let the cauliflower cool for 10 minutes before cutting it into wedges and serving alongside a big green salad with a lime juice and olive oil dressing
