  An old-fashioned whiskey cocktail. this is the way we like ours -- fruity with
  a dash of bitters, soda, and plenty of rocks! be sure to use a good bourbon.
  bottoms up! enjoy! from ehow. history (taken from about.com): the
  old-fashioned is a classic whiskey cocktail that has been served since around
  1880 at the pendennis club in louisville, kentucky and is (disputedly) the
  first drink referred to as a cocktail. it is the perfect ideal of what a
  cocktail should contain: a spirit, a sweet, a bitter, a sour and water.
  typically, the old-fashioned is made with bourbon, however you can experiment
  with other types of whiskey for an equally excellent drink. have a light
  old-fashioned with canadian whiskey or one that's more sour with a tennessee
  whiskey. club soda is often used to top off this drink, but this is not a
  traditional method.
