  This is so easy to prepare and super filling. it's great for when you're short
  on time and i love making it around the holidays for easy morning breakfasts.
  of course you can leave out the green peppers and onions if you don't like
  them. to speed up cooling of the meat, onion, & green peppers you can place
  them in the fridge while preparing the egg mix. when i'm in a hurry i skip the
  onion & pepper and it's still great!
