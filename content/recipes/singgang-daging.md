 - Have spareribs cut into individual ribs and short lengths
 - They are easier to cook and eat this way
 - Rub them with garlic , ginger , and salt
 - Heat oil in a wok and stir fry for 5 or 6 minutes over high heat until ribs are browned
 - Combine all the other ingredients and pour over the ribs
 - Bring to boil , then reduce heat to simmer , cover pan and cook until meat on ribs is very tender and liquid reduced
 - Uncover , stir in honey or sugar until dissolved
 - Serve hot
 - Ribs can be roasted in a preheated moderately hot oven for a few minutes until further glazed and browned
