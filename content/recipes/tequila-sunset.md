description: >-
  This was a popular drink among my circle of friends in the mid-1970s or so.  i
  had almost forgot about it until i came across it recently when visiting the
  drink swap website.  so i thought i would post the recipe here so i wouldn't
  ever forget about it again.  if mixed correctly, the blackberry brandy will
  slowly settle down through the orange juice layer, which creates uneven or
  striated colors that are said to resemble a sunset (hence the drink's name).
