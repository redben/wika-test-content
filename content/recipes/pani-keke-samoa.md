 - Combine the flour , sugar , and baking powder in a bowl until thoroughly mixed , and stir in the bananas , vanilla extract , and water to make a smooth , sticky dough
 - Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees f
 - The oil should be deep enough to completely cover the pani-kekes while frying , or at last 3 inches deep
 - Scoop up a scant 1 / 4 cup of batter with a large spoon , and use another spoon to push it off into the oil
 - Fry in small batches of 4 or 5 until they float to the top and turn golden brown , about 3 minutes , then flip them to fry the other side
 - Remove from the fryer and let drain on paper towels
