description: >-
  This recipe uses three simple ingredients,.  it is perfect for entertaining,
  because it cooks on the back of the stove while everything else is being
  prepared for dinner.  it can be made the day before. the cook time does not
  include the time it takes to boil the sweetened condensed milk.  this pie
  recipe was shared with me by a friendly grocery check-out clerk that i used to
  swap recipes with each week.  she liked my soups and i liked her desserts.
