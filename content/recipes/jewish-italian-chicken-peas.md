  From the ultimate book of main course dishes by jenni fleetwood.  i made some
  jewish recipes for hanukkah, and this turned out to be my favorite.  the best
  thing about this dish is the creamy sauce.., which contains no milk or cream
  at all!  potato latkes taste incredible with this sauce, but you can also
  serve this dish with pasta, mashed potatoes, or even just a piece of crusty
  bread.
