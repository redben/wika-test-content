  This is a little something i whipped up for my husband one year for
  thanksgiving. i was working over time and we didn't have enough money for a
  whole turkey so this was the best alternative i could come up with. it took
  little time and cost less than that big ol' turkey. my husband loves it! i
  hope you enjoy it too.
