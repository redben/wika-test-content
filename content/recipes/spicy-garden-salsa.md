description: "This is a great salsa recipe.  it's very hot and has strong flavors of onion and garlic.  unlike a lot of salsa recipes, this one isn't sweet.  the key ingredient is white vinegar, which really makes the flavors pop.\r\n\r\ni hope you like it as much as i do -  enjoy"

 - Add peeled red onion , salt , white vinegar and minced garlic to blender
 - Add tomatoes - use standard tomatoes if possible , get ones that are vine ripened
 - Choosing good tomatoes makes a huge difference in the flavor !
 - Add jalapeos to blender based on your preferences to the following - leave seeds in for some good heat
 - Remove them to make a milder salsa
 - Jalapeos can vary widely on their heat
 - The ones that are solid green are more mild , while the ones with the white striations up the sides are the hottest
 - Cilantro - grab the leafy end of the cilantro and pull off the thicker stems at the bottom
 - Add leafy part of cilantro to blender
 - Coarsely blend all ingredients and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to allow flavors to meld
