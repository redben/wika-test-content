  A very hot marinade i found on the congo cookbook website. i eat a variety of
  foods so i love spices but also some heat and this is delicious. play with the
  ingredients to tame, i tweaked the recipe a bit. it's really quick to make,
  everything in the blender! perfect on shrimp (for the bbq), but good for
  chicken and pork. (i think it makes around 1/2 to 1 cup)
