title: Beef And Mushroom Stew In Red Wine
date: 2010-03-11T00:00:00.000Z
description: "Size matters when it comes to your pan and properly browning your stewing meat. i use a large 12 inch stew pot. if the cubed beef is too crowded it won't brown properly and steam instead. it's the browning that gives you that rich stew flavor.\r\ni usually buy a cheap cut of meat and cut it up in my kitchen. this way i can trim off as much fat as i like and have the size of cubes i like."

 - Start by creating the oil you will brown the beef in , and the best for a really rich , smoky flavor is bacon fat
 - Dice the bacon and cook in your stew pot over medium-high heat
 - Once the bacon bits are crispy and have rendered all their fat , remove bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside
 - Then pour out all but a tablespoon of the fat and keep the rest handy
 - Combine flour , rosemary , thyme and salt with black pepper to taste and shake with beef cubes until covered
 - Brown half of the beef in the fat , browning on both sides - add fat if it isn't browning properly
 - Remove the first batch of beef and brown the second , including any left over flour mixture
 - Add fat as needed , then remove from the pot and set aside
 - Reduce the heat to medium , mince garlic and add to pan , adding a little fat if needed
 - Once garlic becomes fragrant , add quartered mushrooms and cook briefly
 - Add red wine , stir to deglaze the pan , pour in broth and throw in the cubed carrots and crispy bacon bits
 - Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer
 - Cover and cook on the stove-top until meat is tender , about 1 1 / 2 to 2 hours
