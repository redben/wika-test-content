  *warning!*  don't try this recipe unless you like tooth-breakingly hard,
  crunchy cookies!  this recipe is from the honolulu star bulletin and is a
  copy-cat for mountain view bakery's stone cookies.  people either love 'em or
  hate 'em.  i'm posting this for the die-hards like me who can't get enough of
  'em!

 - Preheat oven to 325 degrees
 - Line cookie sheet with parchment paper or grease lightly
 - Cream butter with sugar until light and fluffy
 - Add eggs and cream
 - Mix well
 - Add baking soda and vanilla
 - Mix well
 - Add flour
 - Mix well
 - Dough may be crumbly
 - Form by hand into 2-inch balls , place on cookie sheet and flatten
 - Bake until very firm and brown , about 35 minutes
 - Check cookies frequently in the last few minutes to be sure they don't burn
 - As long as they feel at all soft in the middle , they need more baking time
 - Cool and store in airtight container
 - The writer of the food article had this
 - If they're the least bit soft , leave them in the oven
 - I actually took mine out a little too early i was afraid they were getting too brown and although they were hard , they weren't rock hard
 - I consider this a plus , but if you really want that tooth-breaking goodness , push the envelope and bake 'em 'til they're solid
