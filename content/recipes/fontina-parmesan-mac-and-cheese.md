description: "There's something amazingly special about creamy, rich, melty, cheese. the kind that makes you smile upon entering your mouth, the kind that you dream about when you think about macaroni and cheese. the marriage between cheese {and not just any kind of cheese} and noodles in this dish is heaven. \r\n\r\ni am known as a macaroni and cheese freak but this recipe puts my love for this comfort-food-beauty on a whole new level. and not to mention this does not come from a box, there is no velveeta block involved...and it is not waste line conscious. relish in the goodness of cheese my little foodies :)\r\n\r\nthis recipe is adapted from my own macaroni and cheese trial-and-error and annie's eat's inspiration with fontina cheese."
