description: "This recipe always cramps my sweet tooth and quenches my chocolate cravings. it is vegan and tastes like ice cream, although the texture is not the same. depending on the size of the banana will depend on the thickness or \"liquidy\" consistency of the smoothie.\r\n\r\ntotal calories - 206/230\r\n\r\nyour option of peanut butter, but that's an extra 100 calories per tablespoon"

 - I use a magic bullet , but a food processor works too
 - Cut the banana in one inch rings and throw in with all ingredients
