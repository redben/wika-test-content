  I've been making this recipe for years, and decided to post it here for safe
  keeping, because the recipe card is getting very tattered. it's one of a
  series of recipe cards i would get in the mail from general mills, many years
  ago. i usually used chicken thighs ( i prefer the dark meat) but would have to
  extend the cooking time by about 15 minutes or so. my family loved it and i
  still make it on occassion.
