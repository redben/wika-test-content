description: >-
  A blend of different recipes i have enjoyed in the past and including
  ingredients popular at my house.  i like to pick out the small newest potatoes
  if i can (without looking like the crazy person in the produce section). 
  simple and pretty quick to prepare and best with fresh herbs if you can.  the
  garlic in this is completely optional, i find it a bit  overpowering myself so
  i leave it out or use very little.
