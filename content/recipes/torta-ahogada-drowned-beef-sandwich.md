  Mr. picky eater claimed this to be the best sandwich he has had in the us.
  this is one good sandwich! you can adjust the heat to your taste by cutting
  back on the chipotles, or adding extra like i did. the recipe makes extra
  sauce so you may want to cut it in half, freeze some for later or leave it
  thick and serve some with chips. i'd also suggest adding extra avocado, cause
  it tastes so good. from ingrid hoffman.
