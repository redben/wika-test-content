title: Baltimore Pit Beef With Tiger Sauce
date: 2013-06-12T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  This regional speciality calls for a large roast to be grilled (but not
  smoked) over intensely hot coals while being flipped constantly to avoind
  burning. the meat comes off the grill well charred, almost black on the
  exterior but not burned, and rosy pink in the center, bordering on rare. the
  meat is sliced thin, piled on kaiser rolls, and top with sliced onions and a
  horseradish-mayonnaise mixture some locals refer to as "tiger sauce". the
  final result is tender, smoky and spicy. in baltimore, a deli slicer is often
  used to shave the meat thinly for sandwiches. it's easiest to cut the roast in
  half lengthwise before slicing it as thinly as possible. from "the best of
  america's test kitchen 2010" by cooks illustrated.
