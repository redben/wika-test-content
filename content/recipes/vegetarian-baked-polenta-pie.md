  ''baked polenta pie is similar to lasagna, but instead of noodles, you get a
  thick layer of creamy polenta as the base. i layered the pie with roasted
  vegetables, tomato sauce, and of course loads and loads of mozzarella and
  parmesan cheese. you bake the pie until bubbly and do your best to not burn
  your tongue when it comes out of the oven. your house will smell so delicious
  you wonâ€™t want to wait to dive in.'' two peas and their pod
