description: >-
  I made japanese keema curry which is called "dry curry" with black eyed peas,
  ground beef and some vegetables (including one of budget ingredients, green
  bell pepper). to make this curry more delicious, i added cocoa powder which
  birings out rich flavor and makes the dish savory. this curry also goes well
  with rice.
