 - Let stand until foamy , about 5 minutes
 - Stir in remaining warm water olive oil and salt
 - Gradually add 1 1 / 2 - 2 cups flour , mixing until smooth

 - Let dough rise until doubled , about 1 hour

 - On a lightly floured surface , roll each dough half into a rectangle about 10" x 8"
 - Arrange fillings over dough as shown in , finishing with a sprinkling of parmesan , italian seasoning , garlic powder and onion powder
 - Roll the dough much like you would if you were making a jelly roll
 - Pinch the edges of the seam and tuck the ends under
 - Cut long diagonal slashes , about 1 / 2 inch deep , along the top of the loaf every 3 inches or so
 - Brush top of loaf with beaten egg , avoiding the area in the slashes
