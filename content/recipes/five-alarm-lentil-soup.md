date: 2011-10-25T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  From the sriracha cookbook by randy clemens, which covers using the rooster
  sauce from soups to desserts. this recipe is the author's homage to his
  firefighter grandfather. reduce the amount of sriracha if you are uncertain of
  how hot you want this to be! i put the servings in as per the author, but i
  think it's more like 6 to 8 servings.
