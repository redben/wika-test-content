title: Lebanese Syrian Fasoulia
date: 2010-01-21T00:00:00.000Z
description: "This dish is similar to bazella, with its tomato-based broth. in this dish, the main ingredients are fasoulia, a type of lima bean and meat. cubes of lamb may be substituted for the beef. i learned how to prepare this dish while i was living in syria for a year, studying abroad. \r\n\r\nplease note: if you use dry lima beans, they must soak in water overnight. the shells may come off of them when you begin to cook them, but this is normal."

 - Brown meat in a large frying pan with some olive oil from the bottle
 - Add season salt if desired or use regular salt and pepper
 - Make sure all pieces of meat have been browned
 - Set aside
 - In a stew pan , over medium heat , add the olive oil and the tomato paste
 - Fry the tomato paste about 5-8 minutes
 - If it seems dry , add more oil in small amounts
 - It should be chunky in the oil , not runny like soup
 - Stir constantly ! this will burn very easily
 - Turn down the heat , add 2 cups of water
 - Stand back , it may spit at you ! continue to add the water in 2-cup increments
 - Add the boullion cubes
 - Stir around and scrape the bottom of the pan to make sure all tomato paste is mixed in the water
 - Add the lima beans and the meat
 - Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer
 - Add salt and pepper to taste
 - Depending on the quality of the meat , it may take 2-4 hours for the meat to become tender
 - Add more water if too much boils out or it is too salty
 - Serve with middle eastern rice
 - This can be prepared in a stainless steel or non-stick pan
 - I prefer non-stick
 - Additionally , it may be transferred to a crock pot to simmer all day
 - Never leave food cooking on the stove unattended !
