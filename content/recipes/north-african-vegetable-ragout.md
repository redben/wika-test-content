description: >-
  The heat of chile, spices of north africa and earthiness of kale beautifully
  complement sweet butternut squash in this hearty ragout. bright, rich and
  healthy, this recipe is easily prepared in 30 minutes making it a delicious
  option for a weeknight. if you prefer an even richer stew, hot italian sausage
  may be added.  most likely, however, you will find that the meatless version
  is substantial and satisfying enough to win over any carnivore. use vegetable
  broth if you wish to keep it vegetarian. be sure to serve the ragout with
  couscous to soak up the liquid.
