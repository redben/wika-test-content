description: >-
  Adapted slightly from vicki's vegan kitchen (square one (2011)). this is a
  super tender, but easy to work with pastry dough that can be modified for
  savoury tarts by simply removing the sugar and nutmeg. this recipe is best
  suited for bottom crusts, but rolled thinly it can be used as a topper too.
  this is also delicious made with sweet potatoes, especially for apple pie.
