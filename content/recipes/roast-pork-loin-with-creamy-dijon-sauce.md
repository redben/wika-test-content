title: Roast Pork Loin With Creamy Dijon Sauce

description: >-
  This is adapted from miss vickie's big book of pressure cooker recipes.  the
  original recipe calls for more sour cream and flour, i reduced them to change
  the final sauce consistency to my personal preference.  the dijon gives the
  sauce a slight bite, and the roast is juicy, tender and perfectly done. miss
  vickie's directions specify not to remove the netting, but i find that
  removing it after cooking pulls off the brown crust, so i remove it and tie
  with kitchen string before browning.
