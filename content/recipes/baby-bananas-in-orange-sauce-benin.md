  Dd (toddler) had us try this one and we both declare it "really yummy!"
  origanally posted for zwt7, sub-saharan africa. an easy dessert that is kid
  friendly yet upscale enough to serve adults. a different way to use bananas as
  a dessert topping. the orange sauce coats the bananas and brightens up vanilla
  ice cream and cake. with recipes like this, i’m not sure why you’d ever eat a
  plain ol’ banana split again! from, globaltableadventure.com

 - Heat orange juice , brown sugar , and lemon juice in a skillet for about 15 minutes on low
 - The orange juice will reduce and thicken into a syrup
 - Peel bananas and add to syrup
 - Cook for a few minutes per side , making sure to warm through
 - Serve immediately with ice cream , pound cake , or plain
 - Both would be all the better !
