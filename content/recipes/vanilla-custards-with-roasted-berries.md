 - In a small saucepan , combine your milk and vanilla bean flecks
 - Heat the mixture until it is warm , then set aside
 - You can also do this in a microwave
 - If your saucepan or microwave dish has a small spout , even better
 - In the bottom of a small saucepan , off the heat , beat or whisk your egg yolks and 1 / 4 cup sugar together vigorously , until it pales in color and a ribbon of batter falls off your whisk when you lift it from the bowl
 - This will take a few minutes by hand , and likely just one minute with an electric mixer
 - Whisk in the flour until fully incorporated
 - Whisking the whole time , drizzle the warm vanilla-milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture , just a tiny bit at a time at first
 - Once youve added about 1 / 4 of the milk , you can add the rest in a thin stream , whisking constantly
 - Bring the saucepan to your stove and heat it over medium-high heat , whisking constantly , until it begins to bubble
 - Once bubbling , whisk it for 1 to 2 more minutes , then remove it from the heat
 - Immediately stir in vanilla extract and butter until combined
 - [updated to add] as a final step for a perfectly smooth and silky custard , you can press the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer
 - You can also skip this step if youre not terribly concerned about an imperfect custard
 - To cool your custard quickly , place the saucepan in a larger bowl of ice water that will go halfway up the sides of the saucepan and stir the custard until lukewarm , then divide among serving dishes or ramekins
 - You can also pour it into serving dishes or ramekins still hot , but you should then press a film of plastic wrap against each custard in the fridge so it doesnt form a pudding skin
 - Custards keep in fridge for up to 4 days
 - To serve: preheat oven to 450f
 - Place blueberries in a heatproof , shallow roasting dish and sprinkle with 1 1 / 2 teaspoons sugar
 - Roast in oven for 12 to 15 minutes , rolling around once or twice during cooking time to ensure they roast evenly
 - The goal is not to let the blueberries fully slump or turn to sauce
 - You just want a little trickle of juices puddled across in the bottom
 - Squeeze a bit of lemon juice over berries the second they come out of the oven and roll them back and forth to evenly incorporate it
 - Spoon hot roasted blueberries and some of their juices over each custard
 - Eat immediately , passing any extra roasted blueberries alongside
