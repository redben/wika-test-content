description: >-
  This is another recipe i got from george stella's cookbook & tweaked for my
  needs. note: looking at my bag of soy flour i see that food.com's nutrients
  facts don't show any fiber in it, which it has. so by my calculation there
  should be 10 net carbs per serving not 15.

 - Mix together the ingredients for the breading mix , set aside
 - Place the chicken on a cutting board then use a meat tenderizing mallet to pound the chicken very thin
 - Heat about an 1 tbsp of oil in a large frying pan
 - Then whisk together the eggs & water to make the egg wash
 - Dip each piece of chicken into the breading mix then into the egg wash & back into the breading
 - Once completely covered gently place the chicken into the hot oil
 - Fry for 2 minutes then flip & continue to fry for another 2 minutes
 - The final result should be golden brown & crispy on the outside
