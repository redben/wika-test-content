description: >-
  I have been making this for many years. i got it from a sunset magazine circa
  1992. it's great to serve any time, for guests and family alike.you can start
  preparing the day before if you like, although it's not hard to put together.
  i have been "modernizing" this of late, and love to sprinkle smoked paprika in
  the meat while it's cooking, what an aroma!use your choice of bell pepper
  colors. i hope you enjoy this as much as i have over the years. **you may make
  the tortilla pieces 1 day ahead of time. you may like to sprinkle the hot
  tortilla chips with smoked paprika,chile powder, or your favorite mexican
  seasoning. i didn't specify as to what type of tortillas to use; use whichever
  type, corn or flour, that suits your family's likes.
