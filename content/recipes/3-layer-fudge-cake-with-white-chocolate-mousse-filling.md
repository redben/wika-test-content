description: >-
  I was looking for a beautiful, rich cake to make for christmas this year and
  this was exactly what i was looking for! i found this recipe online and it
  originally came from bon appetit. i wanted something chocolate and peppermint
  to go with the season. it turned out to be the best cake i've ever made! my
  family wants it to be a tradition for me to make this cake every christmas
  from now on. i hope it turns out just as wonderful for you as it did for me!
  it takes time but it is well worth it. the cooking/preparation time does not
  include the hours it needs to cool in between.
