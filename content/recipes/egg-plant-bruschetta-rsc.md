  Ready, set, cook!  reynolds wrap contest entry.  this is a twist on
  traditional bruschetta.  my family and i eat low carb and we love eggplant and
  this just came from the love of tomatoes and basil.  we have also topped
  zucchini and added meat to this mixture as well.  baking the eggplant on the
  grill or in the oven makes for a lighter dish. hope you like it!

 - Fry chopped bacon in a medium pan until crisp
 - Drain bacon on a paper towel lined plate and set aside
 - Chop basil and tomatoes and set aside
 - To a medium mixing bowl add the cream cheese and microwave on high for 20 seconds to soften
 - Add bacon , tomatoes basil and cheese to cream cheese mixture
 - Add salt and pepper to taste
 - At this point i would add crushed red peppers as we like it spicy
 - You can also add chopped sauted jalapenos if you like also
 - Set this mixture aside
 - Slice eggplant to make circles about inch thick
 - At this point i will cut the skin off mine but if you like the skin you can leave it on
 - Mix egg and ranch is a separate bowl and put panko in another
 - Dip eggplant in egg mixture then in panko and place on a separate dish
 - Once you have dipped all the eggplant you are ready to cook
 - I like to put mine on the grill with a reynolds wrap and parchment lined sheet
 - Spread out a large piece of foil and then a little bit smaller piece of parchment
 - Fold over the edges of foil on the parchment so that it looks like the parchment is on the inside of the foil
 - Place this on your pre heated grill
 - Place your eggplant on the grill and let cook for about 5 minutes or until they start to brown on the bottom
 - Flip over and top with your tomato bacon mixture and leave on the grill until the mixture starts to melt and bubble
 - Serve with a salad and enjoy
