  From bon appetit, september,  2004, this is a recipe from a pittsburgh
  restaurant, "dish osteria and bar".  i made it without the polenta and the
  duck with the lingonberry sauce was amazing.  this is a restaurant quality
  dish and not at all difficult to make.  it was a huge hit at our house.  note
  that the required refrigeration time for the sauce and polenta are not
  included in the cooking time.
