title: Extra Easy Healthy Cream Of Asparagus Soup

description: "I am quickly becoming addicted to this easy to throw together soup. the flavor of the asparagus is carefully balanced so it doesn't take over.\r\n \r\nthe potatoes add body and a creamy texture, so no real cream is necessary! \r\n\r\nwe grow everything (but the sour cream) right here on the ranch so it is super economical- but still inexpensive if you need to buy the ingredients!"
