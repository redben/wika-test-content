 - You can toast your own almonds either in a frying pan or in the oven
 - Be careful to watch them , though , because they will burn quickly
 - In a medium bowl , gently combine chicken breast , toasted almonds , dried cranberries , miracle whip light , celery , onion , salt , and pepper until all is well coated
 - Place one-fourth of the mixture on each of four slices of bread
 - Top with a lettuce leaf and another slice of bread
 - Enjoy !
