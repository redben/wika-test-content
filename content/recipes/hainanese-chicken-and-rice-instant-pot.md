 - Bring to the boil
 - Add the bok choy and reduce to a simmer
 - Cook for a few minutes , only until the bok choy is tender-crisp

 - To serve
 - I like to place everything on the table , for people to help themselves and condiment their food as they wish
 - =)
 - To cook the chicken on the stovetop , just simmer covered until done
 - Check after about 30 minutes
 - Chicken should be cooked through but not falling off the bone
 - For short-grain rice in the ip , for every cup of rice , use 1 1 / 2 cups liquid
 - You could also cook the rice in a rice cooker
 - Follow rice cooker instructions for proportions of rice and liquid for type of rice
 - To substitute for the shaoxing wine , you could use pale dry sherry
 - For a nonalcoholic alternative , try apple juice or white grape juice
 - Add it before the sugar , then add sugar to taste , so the sauce doesn't become too sweet
