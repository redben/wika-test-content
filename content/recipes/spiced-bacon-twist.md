  There is another similar recipe on here but doesn't have the added spices that
  i think make this so special.  i do got this from another sight and made it
  for three very hungry man-cubs breakfast and they all rated it 5 stars.  one
  called it "candy bacon"  hope you like it too.  nest time i'm thinking i'll
  cut back on the brown sugar as i had a lot left over - but left it here as in
  the original recipe.
