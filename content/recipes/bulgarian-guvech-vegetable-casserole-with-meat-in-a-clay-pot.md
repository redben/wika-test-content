description: "This dish has a turkish name and i guess it's origin is turkey. however the recipe i am sharing today comes from the southern part of bulgaria. it is very healthy meal, full with vitamins and protein. it is usually made with pork or beef, tomatoes,okra, mushrooms, peas, green beans, potatoes, eggplant, onions, herbs, and spices and is often served with \"balkan mixed salad\", a combination of roasted eggplant, sweet roasted peppers, garlic, tomatoes.\r\nthe veggies in this dish can vary depending on the season.  here is my version of it. you will need a  large clay bowl with lid."
