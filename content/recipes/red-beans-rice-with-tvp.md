description: >-
  This is from bob's red mill.  i like to use tvp now and again, it has a good
  amount of protein and iron in it, and it's such a versatile product.  this
  involves dried beans so plan ahead or sub tinned.  this is also a no-fat
  recipe (zero oil).  i halved the original recipe as it made a whole heck of a
  lot. adjust the chili powder based on the type you are using.  (prep time
  doesn't include over night soaking).
