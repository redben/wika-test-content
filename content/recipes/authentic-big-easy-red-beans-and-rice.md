  Quick, simple, and filled with real cajun flavor as if you're eating in new
  orleans, louisiana. while simmering, taste for flavor - add a little more
  cajun seasoning if needed. i've combined green, orange, and red bell peppers
  before and it was delicious.  note:  2 tablespoons minced garlic, not 2 cloves
