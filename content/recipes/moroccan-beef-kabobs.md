description: "These kabobs are so full of flavor from the marinade of herbs and spices!  i especially like the flavor the thai red chili paste gives the steak.  i marinate these overnight, and serve it with couscous and a seasonal green vegetable.\r\nnote:  the preparation time does not include the time for marinating."
