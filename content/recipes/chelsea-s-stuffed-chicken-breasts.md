 - Heat oil in skillet
 - Combine goat cheese , 2 cups spinach , sun dried tomatoes in food processor
 - Pulse until well combined
 - Spread mixture on one side of flattened chicken breasts
 - Fold breasts in half , leaving cheese filling inside , and sprinkle on italian seasoning
 - Place in skillet , seasoned side down , and cook on medium until well browned
 - Season exposed side and flip
 - I often use a lid to help the chicken cook , the thinner you pound it the faster it will cook
 - While the chicken finishes cooking , divide the remaining spinach between two plates
 - Add any vegetable garnishes you'd like and drizzle with balsamic vinegar
 - When chicken has reached 165 degrees in the thickest part , remove from pan
 - Let rest , then slice and plate atop spinach
