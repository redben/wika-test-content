  From my favorite inherited cookbook, "cook like a peasant, eat like a king. 
  the cookbook is from the 70's and documents the travels of two california
  "foodies" traveling through europe, eating dishes made by "peasant women" in
  small villages.  this side dish recipe is from switzerland.  i picture it as a
  comforting side dish.  i like the combo of the swiss cheese and parmesan (not
  one i'm used to seeing), highlighting the influences of neighboring italy.
