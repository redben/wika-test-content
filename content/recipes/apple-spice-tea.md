description: "This recipe isn't really a complete original like some of my others since the idea of apple spice tea has been around for ages.  the particular ingredients and quantities, however, are my own doing.\r\n\r\nnote: i've listed things in teaspoons because this website won't let me list it in parts, but it's technically in a ratio, so you can make whatever quantity you want."
