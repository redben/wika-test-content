  From "5 spices, 50 dishes" by ruta kahate. you can use raw beef for this, but
  the far more useful trick is to use leftover beef or lamb roast. (author
  suggested beef roast, but i tried it with lamb and it was great). i think you
  could also use rare deli beef also, for a quick meal. and i'll make potatoes
  like this even if not making the rest of the dish. this is a popular dish
  reflecting the influence of the many cultures that colonized india.
