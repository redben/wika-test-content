 - To make the marinade / sauce , place all marinade ingredients together in a saucepan over medium-high heat
 - Stir as you bring the sauce to a boil
 - Reduce heat to medium and allow to simmer for 10 minutes , uncovered
 - The sauce will gradually thicken
 - When marinade / sauce has thickened , place in the refrigerator or freezer to cool for 5 minutes
 - Place salmon fillets in a flat-bottomed pan or casserole dish
 - When the sauce / marinade has cooled , spoon 2 tablespoons over each fillet , 1 per side , slathering it over the flesh
 - Marinate in the refrigerator 10 minutes or up to 24 hours
 - Place a frying pan or wok on medium-high heat , allowing it to warm up for at least 1 minute before adding the oil
 - When pan is hot , add 1-2 tablespoons oil , lifting and turning the pan to distribute evenly
 - Now place fillets in the pan
 - Allow salmon to fry at least 2 minutes undisturbed before turning
 - If you turn the fish too soon , it will stick
 - Instead , allow it to "sear" , and it will come freely away from the bottom of the pan
 - Fry the fish 3-5 minutes per side , depending on the thickness of the fish
 - Salmon is done when inner flesh is no longer transparent
 - For faster cooking , cover fish while it's frying
 - To serve: arrange on a serving platter or plates
 - Spoon a little of the sauce over each fillet
 - Place the rest in a side dish and serve as a dipping sauce
