  Dh and i took advantage of the nice weather yesterday and made these grilled
  lamb chops for dinner.  the recipe is from bobby flay's "boy gets grill"
  cookbook.  while the recipe calls for baby lamb chops, bobby says you can use
  regular lamb chops, too.  dh and i used lamb loin chops and halved the recipe
  to suit 4 chops (the sauce, when halved, made enough for 6+ chops).  follow
  the recipe's proportion for the garlic.  i am always heavy handed with the
  garlic since we love it, but it was a little strong in the sauce when i used
  more than required.  prep time includes refrigerating the sauce.
