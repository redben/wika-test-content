description: >-
  A really quick fine-dining type recipe! the approximate american weights are
  given in brackets. you can assemble this soup a day ahead, and keep it in the
  fridge to heat gently just before serving. please adjust to your taste. use
  the best quality canned mushroom soup and smoked oysters -- it makes a big
  difference to the end result. it is rich, no excuses, but is served in very
  small portions -- not as generous as my photo seems to indicate!  ps: i think
  that 2 cans of oysters might be better than just one and will improve the
  flavour. if you find the cup of cream too much, use a 1/2 cup plus 1/2 cup
  chicken broth (or more mushroom soup).

 - In a bowl , add all the ingredients except the pepper
 - About the smoked oysters: lift them from the tin with a fork when adding , and by all means use some of the canning oil too , as it adds to the flavour
 - If your oysters are quite large you can halve them
 - Whisk to mix
 - Please taste -- the soup is mild and rich , and you might want to add more lemon juice
 - I didn't measure , just squeezed a good squirt from half a lemon into the soup
 - At this stage the soup can be covered and kept in the fridge overnight , which will be better for flavour
 - To serve , heat very gently , or heat in a bowl in a warming oven
 - Do not boil
 - Serve as starter portions in small ramekins , with fresh rye bread alongside
