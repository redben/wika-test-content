 - Preheat oven to 375 degrees
 - Have a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper
 - Keep the tube of crescent rolls in fridge until ready to use and you have all your ingredients ready to go
 - In a small bowl combine the sugar and cinnamon
 - Set aside
 - Melt the butter in microwave safe bowl and set aside
 - Now , take the tube out of fridge and roll out on a cutting board
 - You want to flatten the dough out with your hands to make a rectangle
 - You don't need to use a rolling pin but you can use one if you want to make the same thickness throughout
 - Spread the butter with a pastry brush over the entire dough
 - Save a little butter for when you have rolled up this up after the filling is inches
 - Sprinkle the sugar / cinnamon mixture over the butter
 - Save a little for when it's rolled up
 - Starting with the shorter end , roll the dough up into a log
 - Brush the remaining butter over the outside of the log and sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over the butter
 - With a sharp knife cut the roll into 8 slices
 - To do this , start by cutting the roll in half then half again until you have 8 slices
 - Place the slices on the baking sheet
 - You will probably still have extra cinnamon sugar mixture so sprinkle that over the cut slices
 - Bake for about 10-12 minutes
 - Turn the pan around after 5 minutes and check after 10 minutes
 - They should look puffed , light brown and the bottoms will look light to medium brown as well
 - Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack
 - To make glaze: in a small bowl blend the powdered sugar with the milk and mix up until you have a glaze consistency
 - If you have a mini whisk this makes for easier mixing
 - You can use a spoon or small fork as well
 - When the rolls are slightly cooled , drizzle the glaze over each roll
 - Enjoy these yummy treats !
