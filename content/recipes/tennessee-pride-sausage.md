  My husband is from tennessee, and now being in california there are things
  that he really misses.  i was going to see if there was a way to get some
  tennessee pride sausage shipped to us and keep a supply in the freezer but my
  father-in-law said its just not like it used to be.  i came across this recipe
  with no intension of coming up with a copy to theirs, but just to explore the
  world of sausage making in general....

 - Combine all ingredients and mix well
 - Store in an air tight container
 - Add 2 tsp of spice mix to 1 pound of fresh ground pork
 - I know our local grocery stores carry fresh ground pork just like hamburger
 - Ask your butcher if you don't see it :)
 - Add a couple tablespoons of oil to pan if your sausage is really lean
 - Pat sausage out into 4-6 patties depending on desired size preference
 - Fry on medium heat for about 4 minutes , flip and fry other side for another 3 minutes
 - Make sure sausage is fully cooked
 - Time may very depending on how thick you make your patties
