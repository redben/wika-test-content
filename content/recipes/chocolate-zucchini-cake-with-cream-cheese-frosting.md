description: >-
  This cake is moist and fudgy, a great way to use up some of your summer
  zucchini. would also be good with chocolate ganache, a thin white icing or
  glaze or even just sprinkled with chocolate chips while hot. *i used hershey's
  special dark cocoa- it's a mix of dutch and regular unsweetened so i think
  either would work here
