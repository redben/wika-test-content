  Contains egg products: always check with your pediatrician. i was so excited
  when my daughter, p2, got her teeth, alas, it was only two. i held off of
  starting her on the more solid meats, but now that she's 12 months old, she
  eats these like crazy. granted, she still only has two teeth lol. i just cut
  these up into little manageable pieces and don't take my eyes off of her. they
  freeze really well too!
