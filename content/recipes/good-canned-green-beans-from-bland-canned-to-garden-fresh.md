  This is how i make my green beans in the winter, when i don't have access to
  fresh produce.  growing up, my mother never would use canned green beans
  because she said they were disgusting and lacked flavor. when i got older,
  someone told me to cook them with oil, and that got me started on the quest
  for the perfect way to doctor canned green beans to make them taste closer to
  fresh.  and here it is!  (tip: i love the big can of hanover green beans, in
  the white can.  they seem to have better flavor.)
