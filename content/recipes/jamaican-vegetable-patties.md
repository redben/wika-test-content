description: >-
  This recipe is from vegetarian times.. to speed up preparation, use pre-grated
  carrots, available in most supermarkets. you can make fresh breadcrumbs by
  trimming and discarding crusts from firm, fresh sandwich bread. tear bread
  into pieces and whirl in a food processor or blender until crumbs form. one
  slice makes about 1/2 cup. the salsa can be made up to 2 days ahead and kept
  in the refrigerator.
