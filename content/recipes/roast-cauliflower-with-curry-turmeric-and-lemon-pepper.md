description: "This is my son's recipe / method and it is awesome. it says it serves four, but you'll want to eat it all yourself. please try to share ;-) \r\neven though there's turmeric in most curry powders, this recipe benefits from even moreâ€”it's so healthy and adds such a great flavor.  you can also add other vegetables: garlic, onions, carrots, potatoes, butternut squash, etc. if the head of cauliflower is huge, add more oil and spices as needed. this would also make a great soup base."
