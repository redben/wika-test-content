description: >-
  You can use any good-quality white fish in this dish, but trout and flounder
  are great choices. you can also do most of the preparation ahead of time, by
  taking the marinated fish outside (use an ice chest for the fish if you are
  going somewhere like a park) and grill it. fish cooks quickly on the grill so
  you should have a spicy meal in minutes.
