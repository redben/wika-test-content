description: >-
  An adaptation of rachael ray's chicken chili verde from the rachael ray
  magazine. i can't find the original on her website any longer. (or in my
  recipe collection!) this is a delicious and different version of your standard
  chili, using salsa verde as its base flavor instead of tomato sauce. we like
  to eat it with tortilla chips like a hearty dip.

 - Chop all vegetables
 - Add chicken and stock to a large dutch oven / soup pot
 - Bring to a boil and poach until chicken is cooked through , about ten minutes
 - Remove chicken and set aside to cool
 - Divide stock in half
 - Meanwhile , in a small sauce pan , add evoo , onion , jalapeno and bell pepper , cook until softened , five to eight minutes
 - Once peppers and onions are cooked , add garlic , cumin , adobo , salsa verde and white beans and two cups of the reserved stock
 - Bring to a simmer
 - In a food processor , pulse tortilla chips dry until well ground
 - Use a high speed setting , you want the chips as finely ground as possible
 - Once ground , add the remaining 2 cups of stock
 - Combine thoroughly
 - Transfer vegetable and stock mixture from sauce pan to the soup pot
 - Shred cooled chicken by hand directly into soup pot
 - Aim for 1 / 2 inches to 1 inches sized pieces
 - Slowly add tortilla chip / stock mixture while stirring
 - Add salt , pepper and cilantro
 - Allow chili to cook down for at least 30 minutes
 - The longer it cooks , the better the flavors meld and the better it tastes , so this is a great meal to prepare early and leave on the stove
 - Tastes even better the next day too , if you manage to hold on to your leftovers !
 - Serve in bowls topped with your favorite chili toppings with extra tortilla chips alongside for dipping
