 - Coat the tuna with the spice blend , then sprinkle both sides with sesame seeds
 - Heat the oil in a pan
 - As the oil heats up , stir in the powdered chicken stock
 - Add the tuna steak and fry lightly on both sides
 - You only want about a quarter of the meat to actually cook through
 - The remaining 3 / 4 on the inside should stay pink
