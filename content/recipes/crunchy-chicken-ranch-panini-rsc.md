  Ready, set, cook! hidden valley contest entry. i love to make panini
  sandwiches for my family. the kids especially like this one because of the
  crunchy ranch topping on the outside. it make it very special. in fact it was
  so good they didn't seem to notice i slipped a  "green" veggie (spinach) in
  there. i am always careful when cooking the panini, however, because if the
  heat is too high it will burn. i also love to use my panini maker that i got
  for christmas but it doesn't get as much of a crunch as a regular pan does.
