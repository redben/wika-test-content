description: "This easy recipe is perfect if you’re watching the calories or on weight watchers. \_they are only 4 smart points each, 3 if you don’t add any cheese. the bagel dough is all the rage on the internet, and is touted as the “two ingredient bagel” recipe, but i wanted a little extra lift and texture to mine, so i added a bit of instant yeast and let it rise a bit for an hour. \_yum! perfect for the kids and when you’re hankering for a hot dog. \_try them in your air fryer for a crispier crust."

 - Assemble dough by whisking together the flour , yeast , sugar and salt
 - With a spatula , stir in the yogurt
 - Mix until dough mostly forms together , then knead in the bowl for about 20 times
 - Spray a small , clean bowl with nonstick cooking spray and place dough ball in bowl
 - Cover with plastic and let rise in a non-drafty place for about an hour
 - Dough wont rise that much , but it will develop great flavor and youll see puffiness in the oven as they bake
 - Preheat oven to 400 degrees
 - If using an air fryer , preheat to 375
 - Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside
 - With a sharp knife , cut down the middle of each hot dog from end to end , being careful not to cut all the way through
 - Using your fingers , insert cheese into each hot dog , dividing the cheese equally
 - Set aside while preparing dough
 - Remove dough from bowl and divide into four equal pieces
 - Cut each of the four pieces in half for a total of eight dough balls
 - Lightly dust the workspace and with a rolling pin , roll one piece of dough into a rectangle until dough is about 1 / 8 inch thick
 - Using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter , slice dough into narrow strips , no more than 1 / 4 inch wide
 - Start at the end of a hot dog and begin wrapping the dough around the hot dog , being careful not to lose the cheese
 - There should be a little space in between the wraps
 - Repeat with all the hot dogs , placing each wrapped dog on the parchment lined baking sheet
 - Beat an egg and brush each wrapped dog with egg wash
 - Bake until golden brown and cheese is bubbling
 - About 15 minutes in the oven or about 12 minutes in the air fryer
