  This was my mother's recipe.  it's a perfect light and refreshing dessert 
  with a lemony zing.   mom made it just the way it is for weeknight dinners,
  but i like to dress it up with raspberry sauce (frozen raspberries in syrup,
  pureed and strained) and some fresh raspberries.  looks great in parfait
  glasses or a glass or crystal bowl for a dinner party.  preparation time
  includes 5 hour chilling time.

 - Start with eggs at room temperature
 - Separate eggs , breaking yolks into the bowl of a nonreactive double boiler
 - Add sugar to the yolks and beat with an electric or immersion mixer until thick and pale
 - Grate the rind from one or both lemons and juice them both
 - Strain the juice
 - Add the rind and the 1 / 2 c , water to the sugar / yolk mix
 - More rind means more lemony flavor
 - I use it all but you may prefer less
 - Place the bowl over simmering water and cook , stirring very often , until the foam has mostly disappeared and the mix is thickened to a thin syrup
 - This takes a while and the foam disappearing is your best clue that it's done
 - Remove from heat
 - Mix the gelatin with 11 / 2 t
 - Cold water and immediately add it to the mix , stirring until the gelatin completely dissolves
 - Set aside to cool
 - Meanwhile , beat the egg whites to soft peaks in an electric mixer
 - Before you start make sure the bowl and whisk are perfectly clean as egg whites will not stiffen well if they touch even a trace of grease
 - Fold whites carefully into the sugar / yolk / gelatin mix
 - It can be hard to get all of the yolk mix folded in , so i flip the ingredients into another bowl so i can see and incorporate any remaining liquid
 - Place into the serving bowl or bowls of your choice
 - Refrigerate 5 hours or until serving time
