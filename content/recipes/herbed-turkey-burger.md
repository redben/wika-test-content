 - Saut the chopped onion in olive oil for 3 minutes over medium heat
 - Add the garlic and saut for another 2 minutes , or until the garlic begins to brown
 - Remove from heat
 - Transfer the onions , garlic , and oil to a large bowl to cool down
 - Once the onions are cool to the touch , add the ground turkey , salt , pepper , and herbs into the bowl
 - Using your hands , gently mix everything until well combined
 - You want the herbs mixed in without overworking the meat
 - Form the meat into patties
 - Here's a burger patty
 - When burger patties cook , the meat contracts from the edges
 - Having the middle part slightly thinner than the edges when raw will help the patties finish with a more even shape
 - Cook on a hot grill or in a hot cast iron frying pan for 5-6 minutes per side , until cooked through
 - If using a grill , coat the grill grates first with a little vegetable oil
 - If using a frying pan , put a little oil in the pan first to help keep the burgers from sticking
 - Serve with toasted buns , and the accompaniments of your choicesliced onions , lettuce , sliced tomatoes , bacon , mayonnaise , mustard , relish , ketchup
