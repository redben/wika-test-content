description: "This is the exact hot slaw recipe from the world famous forest view gardens that used to be in cincinnati. unfortunately the place closed down years ago but that won't stop you from recreating the exact recipe they used in your own kitchen! what i have below is precisely the quantities and procedure we used for large scale production for a lot of people. if you are doing a smaller party or dinner, you can adjust the amounts accordingly. keep in mind that the excess dressing can be refrigerated.\r\n\r\ntips:\r\ndo not let this hot slaw sit around with dressing in it. it must be fresh!\r\ndon't over fill the bowl with dressing. i personally like just enough dressing to wet the cabbage and bacon and not a drop more.\r\nmake a whole gallon of dressing and bacon bits and store what you don't use for later. at forest view gardens, we made 30 gallons of dressing and 200 pounds of bacon bits on thursday and it lasted the whole week!"
