description: >-
  Hoe cakes were the first simple forms of corn bread in the south.  simple corn
  meal mixed with water and salt and then baked.  originally, native americans
  cooked these on hot rocks in an open fire.  they were commonly referred to as
  ash cakes.  later, settlers from europe adopted the recipe, cooking the cakes
  on the blades of their hoes in the fireplace. slaves baked theirs on a plank
  or the cotton hoe on hot embers.  this is where they get the name “hoe
  cake”.   serve hoe cakes as bread or as a side item with dinner or as
  breakfast with butter and syrup.
