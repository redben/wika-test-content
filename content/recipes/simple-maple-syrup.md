  After learning that the inexpensive maple syrup you buy in the store is
  extremely bad for you, i decided i needed to find a way to make my own. after
  searching through dozens of recipes and some trial and error, this is what i
  came up with. you can find maple extract in the grocery store near the vanilla
  extract. one batch of this recipe costs almost nothing.
