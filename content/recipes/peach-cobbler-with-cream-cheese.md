  The daughter of a friend gave me this recipe. i've been making cobblers all my
  life but nothing tops this.  by far the best cobbler i've ever made.  i was a
  little hesitant about the crescent rolls but wow, the combination of flavors
  is amazing. thanks sherry for this recipe.  can't wait to try it with
  different pie fillings.
