description: "This is a really thick hot chile. i myself don't use the hot peppers or tabasco sauce. i also use the ground red pepper instead of the crushed red pepper. i like my chili a little more thinner so i also add tomato juice. \r\nmake this on a nice cold day and it'll heat you up in no time."
