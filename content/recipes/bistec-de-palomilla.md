  Adapted from vivette castro by kim severson for the new york times, march 4,
  2009.  many cubans in miami wax lyrical about bistec de palomilla, the cuban
  national steak, and debate whether lemon juice is a reasonable substitute for
  lime juice in the marinade. people weighed in on the etymology of the word
  “palomilla” and the political leanings of the late nitza villapol, the cuban
  cooking teacher who codified the nation’s cuisine in books and on television.
