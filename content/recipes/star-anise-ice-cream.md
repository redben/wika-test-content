description: >-
  Star anise's licorice-like flavor is what sets this ice cream apart. this
  version is adapted from the one served at geordy's restaurant in san
  francisco, where the custard is made with all cream, no milk. time given does
  not include chilling time for the custard. for the freezing time i'm going by
  my ice cream machine, yours may be different.
