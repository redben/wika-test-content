description: "From most recent book. haven't tried.\r\nservethe cod in shallow bowls with soup spoons so you don't leave any of the rich sauce. this recipe is best made with red, full-flavored, spanish pequillo peppers, which you usually find among the other jarred peppers in the supermarket. you could use roasted red pepper instead."
