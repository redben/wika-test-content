  This recipe came from a italian lady, who gave her daughter the directions and
  ingredients in italian!  the daughter translated it into english.  my father
  and i then worked on coming up with the proper amounts.  my father had a
  wonderful sense of humor and recommended that you should "press the liquid out
  of the eggplant by running over it in the driveay,  with a lincoln
  continental."  for those of you that don't have access to a lincoln
  continental, i recommend putting the eggplant in a colander, placing a plate
  over the top of it and adding heavy weights to press the liquid out!!  this is
  an elegant way to eat eggplant and makes a great appetizer!!
