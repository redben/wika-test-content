  This great dish i originally had in a small south carolina restaurant and
  absolutely fell in love it it. we had it for lunch one day and it was totally
  amazing. with a little help from the waiter, who also worked in the kitchen,
  he was able to give me a couple of parts i couldn't figure out and after a
  couple of tries, i came up with what ... i think is pretty close. first off it
  certainly is not difficult even though it sounds like it, it is not quick
  cooking, that i admit, but it certainly isn't expensive and again ... isn't
  hard to do. a loaf layered with chicken, ham, mortadella, salami, artichokes
  and parmesan cheese. baked slow in a water bath and then chilled. sliced and
  served with a garlic herb aioli for a great lunch or light dinner. i have
  served this as a dinner course with a bowl of fresh soup to start, and then
  the terrine served over some fresh baby greens, and roasted vegetables which
  makes for a great light meal. if you want, this can also be sliced and then
  cut in half or quarters and served over some greens with the aioli for a light
  starter. i promise the guests will love it.

 - Chicken -- first thing to do is to pound out the chicken
 - Place the chicken between plastic wrap and pound until thin
 - You can use a rolling pin , meat mallet or even the bottom of a heavy pan
 - Anything will work
 - The chicken will be used for two layers of the loaf so i try to cut the chicken in 2-3 smaller pieces so the chicken will fit to make the layers
 - Dipping station -- layout out your dipping station -- 1) well beaten eggs in one pie pan or small flat dish
 - 2) parmesan , seasoned salt , pepper , cayenne , and lemon zest in the other
 - Pan -- line a loaf pan with parchment paper , bottom and sides and spray with non-stick spray
 - I use scissors and cut down the corners of the parchment paper to make it fit easier
 - Layer 1: chicken - dip 1 / 2 of the chicken in the egg and then in the parmesan mixture and place in the bottom of the loaf pan
 - Fit the pieces in well and tight so it covers the entire bottom of the pan
 - Layer 2: mortadella and proscuitto - top the chicken with the mortadella slices and then 1 / 2 of the proscuitto
 - Layer 3: artichokes - slice the artichokes in 1-3 pieces , depending on the size
 - Then dip 1 / 2 of the artichokes in the egg and then in the parmesan and place on top of the mortadella and proscuitto
 - Layer 4: fresh basil leaves -- all of the basil leaves
 - Layer 5: chicken again - same as above
 - Dip the remaining chicken in the egg and then parmesan and put on top of the artichokes
 - Layer 6: salami - top the chicken with all of the salami and then the remaining proscuitto
 - Layer 7: artichokes - last layer
 - Once again , dip in the egg and then parmesan and top the salami and proscuitto
 - All done -- cover with a piece of parchment paper and here is the key - it needs to be weighted down
 - Take a brick and cover it with aluminum foil
 - That really works best
 - Place on top of the parchment paper and now you are ready to bake
 - If you don't have a brick , just open a bag of beans and pour them on a sheet of foil and wrap up
 - Just something heavy to weigh the terrine down
 - Bake -- put the loaf pan in another pan , like a 13x9 , filled 1 / 2 way with warm water
 - Then bake at 350 for 1 1 / 2 hours on the middle shelf
 - The water will keep the terrine from getting too brown and let it cook slower
 - Remove and let cool completely , cover well with plastic wrap , and refrigerate overnight
 - Aioli -- mix all the ingredients together
 - Mayonnaise , lemon , herbs and garlic
 - Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve
 - This can be made ahead of time
 - Serve -- remove the plastic wrap and the top parchment paper from the terrine , then put a plate on top and flip over
 - Remove the parchment paper and then thin slice
 - You can serve this for a buffet too , it is so pretty to serve
 - I like to serve the slices over a bed a greens and top with the garlic herb aioli
 - Enjoy this great unique dish !
