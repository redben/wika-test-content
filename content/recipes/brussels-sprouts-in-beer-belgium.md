description: >-
  I used this recipe for week 26 of my food blog, "travel by stove." i am
  attempting to cook on meal from every nation on earth, and belgium is my 26th
  stop. i never use any recipe for my blog that i'm not reasonably sure is from
  authentic or traditional sources, and this recipe has been posted without any
  alternations or additions to the ingredients. please beware: i didn't like
  this recipe because i find brussels sprouts bitter enough without the addition
  of dark beer. you need to be a fan of that bitter flavor to appreciate this
  dish. if you don't think you are, please don't make this.
