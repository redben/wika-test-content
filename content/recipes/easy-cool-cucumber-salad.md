  I adapted this from a recipe from the june 2011 issue of the food network
  magazine; as i only had about half the ingredients i had to improvise. glad i
  did, it's a tasty and cooling side dish i'll enjoy during our cabo hot season.
  hope someone out there enjoys it.

 - Peel the cucumber and slice very thin
 - Put in a bowl and toss with the salt
 - Chill one hour
 - Drain , then pat dry
 - Return to bowl and stir in the crema and onion , season with fresh ground pepper
 - Chill and serve
 - The original recipe called for re-constituted dried onion flakes and pickled cherry peppers , which i didn't have
 - It also called for some sugar , but the mexican crema was perfectly sweet enough for me
 - Should i ever find the pickled peppers , though , i'd like to try adding them
