  Posted for zwt6 for greece region: these tasty fritters are very easy to
  prepare and can be served as a side dish or as a light snack on their own. 
  found on authentic greek recipes website.  not sure of the amount of servings
  but i'm guessing for an appetizer or light snack about 4 servings.  prep time
  includes time needed for zucchini to drain properly.
