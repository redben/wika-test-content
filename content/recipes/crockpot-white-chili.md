  This recipe comes from the book:  "make it fast, cook it slow" by stephanie
  o'dea.  it is a very tasty, not too hot chili that is just right for these
  cold winter days.  i added little cubes (less than 1/2-inch) of 3 uncooked
  chicken breasts to this chili about half way through the cooking for a little
  more protein, as though it needs it.  it didn't hurt one bit!  the author says
  this is a soupy chili but i did not find it so.  it has great flavor.  she
  cautions that the beans sink while the corn floats.  so you need to dig down
  to the bottom of the bowl to make sure you get beans in every bite.

 - Add all ingredients to the crockpot as you open or prepare them
 - You do not need to drain and rinse the beans or the chilies
 - I used a 3-1 / 2 quart crockpot which was quite full but you could use a 4-1 / 2 quart size also
 - Cover and cook on low heat for 8-9 hours
 - Add 2 or 3 uncooked chicken breasts cut in a small dice halfway through the cooking time if you wish
 - To serve: season to taste with salt and pepper if needed
 - Serve topped with shredded mozzarella cheese if you wish
