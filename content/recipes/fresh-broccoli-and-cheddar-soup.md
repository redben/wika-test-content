description: >-
  This soup is easy comfort food using fresh (not frozen) broccoli and real
  cheddar cheese.  it takes about half an hour to forty minutes to make, but
  it's so much better than any soup from a can.  i like to leave some of the
  broccoli in large chunks rather than pureeing it all.
