 - Preheat oven to 350f
 - Toast almonds on baking sheet until golden start checking after 8 minutes to avoid burning
 - When you can smell the nuts , they are generally ready
 - Reduce oven to 300f
 - In a food processor or blender , chop chocolate chips with up to 1 / 2 c flour to make chocolate crumbs
 - Beat the eggs with the sugar and vanilla until well combined
 - Sift together the remaining flour , cocoa powder , baking soda , and salt
 - Combine flour mixture with egg mixture , then stir in the chocolate crumbs and toasted almonds
 - Using a spatula and floured hands , shape dough into long skinny loaves either 3 12-inch loaves or 2 16- to 18-inch loaves onto a parchment-lined baking sheet
 - Make sure to leave 2
 - 5 inches between loaves
 - Bake for 45 minutes on the lower rack
 - Remove from oven and cool on the pan
 - Carefully peel loaves from parchment
 - Slice on a diagonal into 1 / 2 inch slices
 - Bake again at 300f for another 20-25 minutes
