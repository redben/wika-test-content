  These spicy little meat pies are tasty and quite simple to make.  the recipe
  is based on one posted in a forum about ambergris caye.  using a food
  processor to make the dough is not only a time-saver, but you'll know it's the
  right consistency when a ball forms in the bowl.

 - Combine the first 9 ingredients in a deep skillet over medium heat
 - Brown , lower heat and simmer for 20 minutes
 - Meanwhile , make the pastry dough by combining the flour , baking powder , salt and shortening and mixing until it resembles fine bread crumbs
 - Slowly add 1 tablespoon cold water at a time , incorporating after each addition , until the mixture comes together in a firm ball
 - It should not be sticky
 - Divide the mixture into two discs and let rest for about 15 minutes before rolling out into a round about 1 / 8 - 1 / 4" thick
 - Cut out twelve 2 1 / 2 - 3" circles in each round
 - Place a circle at the bottom of each muffin well in a 12 muffin tin and press lightly along the bottom and sides to form the pie bottoms
 - Place the meat mixture in each pie bottom leaving about 1 / 4 " of dough above the filling on the sides
 - Place a circle on top of each filled pie and crimp to seal the edges
 - Pierce a small hole in the top with a knife point to allow steam to escape while baking
 - Bake the pies at 350 degrees f for 15 - 20 minutes until nicely browned
 - Let cool until they can be handled and serve
