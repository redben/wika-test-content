  This recipe is amazingly versatile.  my friend sirisha from south india gave
  it to me.  read the end for how to change it for the different versions.  some
  of the ingredients are more easily available in indian grocery stores
  (particularly the dal and curry leaves).  you can sub half a jalepeno for the
  chile... leave the seeds or take them out as your spicy preference dictates. 
  i always take the seeds out of the thai chiles, and it comes out "moderately
  spicy."
