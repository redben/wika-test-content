  With zucchini noodles & soy crumbles, this lasagna sounds awful, but after a
  full helping my father, who is anti anything low-fat, low-carb or "fake meat",
  delclared this lasagna delicious!  preparation is a little time consuming, so
  i freeze it in mini loaf pans so that we can get 5 or 6 dinners out of one
  preparation.  my husband also loves it and requests it!   we split one of the
  loaf pans and pair it with a salad or a little soup.
