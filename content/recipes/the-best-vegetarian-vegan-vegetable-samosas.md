description: "Modified from: “madhur jaffrey’s world-of-the-east vegetarian cooking”\r\nthese are delicious! the effort of making your own samosa crust, instead of buying phyllo dough, is well worth it. \r\n__________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nsamosas may be served at room temperature or they may be served warm. samosas may be made ahead of time (up to a day), refrigerated neatly in flat plastic containers, and then reheated in a 350 degree oven. if you wish to freeze samosas, fry them partially, drain them, and freeze them in a single layer in flat plastic containers. when you wish to eat them, defrost and fry them a second time."

 - Sift the flour and salt into a bowl
 - Add the softened butter and rub it in with your hands so that the flour resembles fine bread crumbs
 - Add warm water , a tablespoon at a time , and begin to gather the flour into a ball
 - You will need 5 tablespoons of water
 - Form a ball and begin to knead it
 - Knead well for about 10-15 minutes or until dough is very soft and pliable
 - (if you have a food processor , put the steel blade in place and empty the sifted flour and salt into a container
 - Add the softened butter and turn on the machine
 - When you have a bread-crumb consistency , begin to add about 5 tablespoons of water slowly through the funnel
 - Stop when the dough forms a ball
 - Take out the ball and knead it for 5-10 minutes or until it is very soft and pliable
 - )
 - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it sit for an hour in the refrigerator
 - The dough can be made a day in advance and refrigerated
 - Make the stuffing
 - Peel the potatoes and dice them into roughly 1 / 4-inch pieces
 - Heat the 4 tablespoons oil in a 10-12 skillet over a medium flame
 - Put in the onion , stirring and frying until it turns a light-brown color
 - Add the peas , the ginger , chinese parsley , and 3 tablespoons of water
 - Cover , lower heat and simmer very gently until peas are cooked
 - Stir every now and then and add additional water , a tablespoon at a time , if the skillet seems dried out
 - Now put in the diced potatoes , salt , coriander , garam masala , roasted ground cumin , & lemon juice
 - Keep heat on low and mix the spices with the potatoes
 - Continue cooking gently , stirring frequently , for 3-4 minutes
 - Check salt and lemon juice
 - Turn off heat and leave potato mixture to cool
 - Take the dough out of the refrigerator and knead again
 - Divide dough into 12 equal balls
 - Keep balls covered with plastic wrap
 - Place a small bowl of water on your work surface
 - Lightly flour on a pastry board
 - Flatten one of the dough balls on it and roll it out into a round about 6 in diameter
 - Now cut the round in half with a sharp knife
 - Pick up one half and form a cone , making a 1 / 4 overlapping seam
 - Using a little water , from the nearby bowl to create the seam
 - Fill the cone with a heaping tablespoon of the stuffing
 - Close the top of the cone by sticking the open edges of the triangle together , again with the help of a little water
 - This seam should also be 1 / 4 wide
 - Press the top seam again and , if possible , flute it with your fingers
 - Put the samosa on a platter in a cool spot
 - Make all 24 samosas this way
 - Heat oil for deep frying in a wok or other wide utensil over medium-low flame
 - When the oil is hot , drop in the samosas , as many as will lie in a single layer
 - Fry them slowly until they are golden brown , turning them over when one side seems done
 - When the second side of the samosas has turned a golden color , remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper-towel-lined platter
 - Do all samosas this way
