description: "I love steamed fish, but my husband doesn't.  this is the only way that i can get him to eat fish that isn't fried or raw.  :-)  the curry flavor is not spicy, and helps tone down the \"fishiness\" of the fish.  if you can use fresh spices, the flavor will be better.\r\nthis recipe is inspired by my favorite curry recipe.  for the zwt6 wild card challenge no nonsense nibblers."

 - You can use frozen or defrosted fish fillets
 - I usually use the frozen fillets , because it is simpler
 - Preheat the oven to 375f
 - In a small bowl , stir together the corriander , cumin , tumeric , ginger , dry mustard , cinnamon , cloves , and chili pepper
 - Mix well
 - For a spicier flavor add more chili powder
 - Stir the softened butter and ketchup into the curry mix , to make a paste
 - Lay out three pieces of tinfoil , large enough to wrap each fillet inches lay a fillet on each piece of foil
 - Spread each fillet with the curry butter paste
 - Wrap each fillet with the foil , so that they are in sealed packets
 - Bake for 15-25 minutes until fish is white and flaky
 - Baking time depends on the starting temperature of your fish and the size of each fillet
 - A palm sized defrosted fillet will be done in 15 minutes , a larger frozen fillet will take 25 minutes
 - Serve over brown rice , pouring the baking juices from the pouch over the rice , and then setting the fish on top
