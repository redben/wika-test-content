  As a chinese-food-aholic, i'm constantly in search of low carb alternatives. 
  i've tried cauliflower fried rice, and just could not get around the texture,
  so rather than trying to fill a void with poor alternatives, i decided to make
  something just as good - but different.  the recipe is intended as a simple
  base recipe, add whatever you like.  keep in mind, the flavor comes from the
  sesame oil, and the soy sauce.  those ingredients are non-negotiable.
