description: >-
  I've had this recipe for a long time. it's the only crust my wife asks for
  whether i'm making pot pies, fruit pies or turnovers. it makes awesome
  homemade hot pockets too. you can substitute whole wheat flour for all or some
  of the ap flour. this is enough for a 9 inch 2 crust pie, two 9 inch single
  crust pies or 10-12 hot pockets. you can double the recipe if you have a
  really big mixing bowl for oamc.
