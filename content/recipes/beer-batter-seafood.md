  Adapted from betty crocker with minor changes.  not the typical louisiana
  cornmeal fry batter, but pretty good.  i've had great success with copycat
  bisquick recipes from zaar.  double the recipe for a batch of onion rings on
  the side.  if desired, season the batter to taste with old bay or cajun
  seasoning blends in place of salt and pepper.
