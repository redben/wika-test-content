 - You will need a sterile mason jar with lid large enough to hold your full fat coconut milk
 - If you use the full can your yogurt with be liquidy like a thick gravy
 - If you want a thick yogurt with less liquid put the can in the refrigerator for a few hours until the milk comes to top and the liquid is on bottom
 - Skim off the full coconut milk layer and put into sterile jar
 - Add the kefir or opened probiotic capsule and stir into coconut milk
 - Cap the jar and place in oven with the light on for 24 hours
 - The light and insulation from the oven will keep the temp around 105-110 degrees
 - When it is done fermenting take it out and store in refrigerator or use it the same way you would use any other yogurt
