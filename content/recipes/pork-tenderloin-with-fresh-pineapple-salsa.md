 - Preheat oven to 450 degrees f , then put the pork tenderloin in a roasting pan
 - In a small bowl , combine 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar with the dijon mustard , paprika & ginger , then spread half of this mixture over the pork tenderloin , before baking uncovered for 15 minutes
 - When the 15 minutes are up , spread the pork with the remaining brown sugar mixture & bake 15 to 20 minutes longer , or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees f , but if you're a traditionalist , you'll want the thermometer to read 160 degrees f !
 - Meanwhile , for the salsa , in a small mixing bowl , combine the bell pepper & onion with the last tablespoon of brown sugar , along with the cup of diced pineapple & pineapple juice
 - When the pork comes out of the oven , let it stand briefly before slicing the meat & serving it with a generous portion of salsa
