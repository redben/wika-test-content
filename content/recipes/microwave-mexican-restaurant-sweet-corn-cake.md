description: >-
  Copy cat recipe. i wanted a quick recipe to copy the sweet corn cakes that are
  served at mexican restaurants like el torito and chi chi's. this is ready to
  eat in about 15 minutes. if you don't have masa harina flour on hand, you can
  add an additional 1/4 cup of yellow cornmeal, but the masa harina flour adds
  the authentic taste to this dish. for a less sweet dish, reduce granulated
  sugar to 1/3 cup. for a firmer sweet corn cake, microwave an additional
  3-minutes.
