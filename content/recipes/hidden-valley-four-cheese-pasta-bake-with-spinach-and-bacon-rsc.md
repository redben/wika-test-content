description: >-
  I chose cavatappi pasta for this recipe because the shape is not only fun, but
  it also helps to hold the sauce and other ingredients better.  i selected
  those particular types of cheese because i feel like they take this recipe up
  a notch from being an average weeknight dinner to something you might even
  choose to make for company. i used fully cooked apple-smoked bacon, which i
  found at trader joe's along with the havarti, gruyere & fontina cheeses. 
  since i used such rich and flavorful cheeses, i chose to use 2% greek yogurt
  and 2% milk instead of using sour cream and half & half so the recipe wouldn't
  be laden down with heavy ingredients.
