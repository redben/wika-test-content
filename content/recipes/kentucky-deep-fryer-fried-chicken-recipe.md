description: "Adapted from a recipe found on the internet and made in my vintage sunbeam fryer/cooker. this is awesome!\r\nfor the chicken pieces, make sure that they are not too big: whole drumstick, whole thigh, but the breast part should be chopped into two. its also helpful to use the fryer cover-it helps the meat cook through properly."
