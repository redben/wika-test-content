 - Slice onion into thin rings , but not super thin , a little thicker than you would put on a sandwich !
 - In a large frying pan melt the butter over medium high heat until slightly sizzling and browning
 - Saute onion rings in the butter , when close to being brown and caramalized , add the peas , and continue to cook for about 8-10 minutes until the peas are done but not mushy !
 - Salt and pepper to taste !
