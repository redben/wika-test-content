  I never cared for meat in my lasagna and made quite a fine one without it. 
  however, at the prodding of my family, i decided to try a meat version and it
  certainly was a big hit.  initially, since i didn't care for sausage, i only
  used 1/2 pound, but you can mix up the measurements of ground beef and sausage
  to your personal preference, as long as it totals 1-1/2 pounds.  being
  italian, i insist you use ricotta cheese (i personally had never heard of
  cottage cheese in a lasagna until this site). finally, i use the no-cook
  lasagna noodles, but feel free to use whatever you like.   enjoy!
