  This recipe is one i concocted a few nights ago after several days of longing
  for a rice dish my french grandmother used to make.  i don't remember what it
  was called or exactly how she made it, but this tastes almost like i
  remember.  it's very simple and quick, especially using cooked rice.  i do not
  add any salt or spice to this, as i don't remember her adding that to it, and
  the bacon adds more than enough flavor.  i used leftover white rice, but brown
  rice would be really good.
