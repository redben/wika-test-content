description: "I know there are alot of challah recipes on here but this is really great! \r\ni use bread flour but the recipe calls for all purpose. i also use the kitchenaid mixer to make the dough. this challah is not too sweet , if you like a sweeter challah then add 1 tb honey and increase the sugar to 4 tsp."
