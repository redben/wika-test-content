 - After peeling the parsnips , cut them into sticks the size of your pinkie finger
 - Dry off any moisture with a paper towel or sacking cloth
 - Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat then add the parsnips , tossing to coat
 - Sprinkle the parsnips with the nutmeg
 - Cover the skillet tightly with a lid and cook the parsnips over medium heat for approximately 10 minutes or until the parsnips reach a golden brown color
 - All stoves are different so if it looks like the parsnips may be cooking too quickly , lower the heat
 - Add the water , place the lid back on the skillet and steam until the water has evaporated and the parsnips are golden , tender and caramelized
 - Season to taste with salt and pepper
 - Serve immediately
