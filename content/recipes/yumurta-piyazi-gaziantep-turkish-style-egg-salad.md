  Spruced up from turkishcookbook.com. i hardboil eggs the same manner as the
  woman who posted this recipe on her site: "i love eggs cooked 'between soft
  boiled and hard boiled' so i only leave the eggs in the hot water for 4
  minutes." i couldn't determine by looking at the photo posted on her site if
  she used italian/flat leaf parsley or curly parsley for that reason i'll let
  you choose. if using sumac, omit the salt. a few turkish olives garnished over
  the salad doesn't sound like a bad idea either.
