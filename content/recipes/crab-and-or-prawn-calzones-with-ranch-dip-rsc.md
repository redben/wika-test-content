  Ready, set, cook! hidden valley contest entry.  i am always looking for new
  ways to enjoy the delicious dungeness crab when the season is upon us. this is
  my family's favorite so far. it combines all of our favorite ingredients and
  gives us the excuse to dip... what ever gets better than that? it is also
  excellant made with prawns or a combination of crab and prawns.
