 - Fit the top of a clean , dry , empty 2-liter soda bottle with a funnel
 - Pour the sugar and yeast into the bottle
 - Swirl gently to distribute the yeast through the sugar
 - Leave the funnel in the bottle and set aside
 - Combine the citrus juice and the grated gingerroot in a measuring cup and swirl to mix
 - Pour through the funnel into the bottle
 - There may be some ginger and citrus pulp left in the funnel and measuring cup
 - That is okay ! to rinse the additional pulp out of the measuring cup and into the bottle add clean drinking water to the measuring cup and swirl
 - Pour this through the funnel
 - That should have cleaned out the measuring cup and the funnel
 - Remove the funnel and screw the cap on tightly
 - Shake the bottle vigorously to mix
 - Remove the cap and fill the bottle to within an inch of the top , cap tightly and invert repeatedly to dissolve sugar
 - Use your thumb to press in the side of the bottle and take
 - Place bottle in a warm place for about 24-48 hours , or until the bottle is very firm
 - When the bottle does not yield to firm pressure it is time to refrigerate ! do not leave the bottle out for more than 48 hours as you run the risk of it bursting after that point
 - Chill completely , preferably overnight , slowly open the bottle , and pour over ice
 - If you find pulp and small bits of ginger objectionable , strain the soda over your ice
 - Rinse the bottle out with water immediately after pouring your last glass if you plan to reuse it for your next batch otherwise it will be impossible to clean out
