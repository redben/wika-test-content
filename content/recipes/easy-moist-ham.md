  I made this ham for christmas this year. it was delicious! it's very easy to
  do and my family loved the crunchiness of the crust baked on it. it was very
  moist.  i watched for hams to go on sale and bought a spiral cut 1/2 ham since
  we only have 5 people (adults). we had enough for leftover sandwiches and then
  i made a pea soup too!

 - Foil line a lipped baking sheet
 - Place the ham with the large side down on the foil
 - Mix the applesauce , brown sugar and mustard in a bowl and then use your hands to cover the ham all the way around
 - Cover ham with foil
 - Put it into a 350 degree oven at 350 degrees for 14 minutes per pound
 - After it's done cooking , take off the foil and use your hands to cover the ham again in the sauce
 - Lather it on their well to create a crust
 - Bake some more until the crust is crispy
 - When done , let the ham rest for about 1 / 2 an hour
 - Then spoon the pan drippings in between the slices for more goodly sweetness
 - Serve while warm --i served it with cheesy mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives and cheese and brocolli
 - Served with some warned up buns from the baker and sweet cream salted butter
 - Enjoy !
 - Save the leftovers for ham sandwiches
 - Take the end part of the ham and put it in a big pot , add carrotts , onions , peas and chicken stock to cover
 - Add some spices that you like
 - We ate that with rolls for christmas dinner after going to the movies all day
 - So , three meals in one ham ! total cost for all three meals for 5 people was less than $10
 - Including purchasing all the ingredients
 - This'd be a great easter recipe too !
