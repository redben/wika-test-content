  Very good greek stew, i love the addition of cinnamon to the meat!  the
  original recipe also calls for 1 tsp salt, which i leave out as we try to
  reduce our sodium intake as much as possible.  i also leave out the onions
  because i don't care for them and the stew still has plenty of flavor that
  way, in my opinion.  we do this in the crock pot, but the original says that
  you can cook the stew in a heavy kettle, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.
