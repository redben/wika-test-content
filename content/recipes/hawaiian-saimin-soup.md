description: >-
  An inexpensive noodle and broth soup, saimin is the favorite local fast food
  of the hawaiian islands (also considered the national dish of hawaii). it is
  considered the supreme comfort food of the islands, eaten at any time of day.
  you can find this soup at snack bars, coffee shops, and even on the mcdonald's
  menu (in hawaii only). saimin is basically the same thing as ramen, a japanese
  noodle soup. in hawaii, you will get the real thing, fresh, thin white noodles
  in a clear broth with green onions, kamaboko (fish cakes), and sometimes ham
  or char siu (pork). some people add chicken, eggs, shrimp, and whatever else
  is desired. the saimin is eaten very hot with chopsticks or spoons, and the
  broth is then drunk from the bowl. do not be afraid to slurp, as there is
  simply no quiet way to eat saimin. the prep time really varies, depending on
  what toppings you choose. enjoy!
