description: >-
  This is an easy fish recipe with light, bright flavors.  you can use any mild
  flavored, firm, white fish; but halibut is my favorite with this.  watch the
  fish carefully as it cooks, if you overcook it, it will be rubbery.  make sure
  that the tomato you choose is fully ripe- this will not come out tasting right
  with under ripe tomatoes.
