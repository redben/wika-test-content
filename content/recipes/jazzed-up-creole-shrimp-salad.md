description: "Fat tuesday is today the first day of dining on a dollar \r\nand what better way then to enjoy is with a no cook meal made with my twist on a remoulade sauce. lent starting the day after making this is a good dish for abstinence from meat. then when the days get hot its a cooling, refreshing eats! enjoy the salad over a beg of greens, stuffed in an avocado or on muffuletta or baguette. if you double the dressing add a pound of cook pasta for a delish pasta salad.  try crab meat, or canned salmon or crawfish."
