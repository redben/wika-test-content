description: "This recipe is from week 10 of my food blog, \"travel by stove.\" i am attempting to cook one meal from every nation on earth, and antarctica is my 10th stop (yes i know antarctica is technically not a country, but i do love a challenge). \r\n\r\nthis recipe came from a transcript of a sous chef cooking them at mcmurdo station in antarctica. the transcript did not provide the measurements; i had to guess on those."
