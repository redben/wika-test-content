description: >-
  No, no! heaven's no not [that] kipper (herring)! this is tasty dish's version
  of kipper the dog's and tiger's picnic sandwich (at least from what we've been
  able to ascertain) kipper and jake go on a picnic and kipper eats cheese
  sandwich while tiger's enjoys his jam sandwich..or something to that effect.
  use your child's favorite type of cheese and bread and favorite jam flavor. we
  tried tillamook cheddar cheese slice and dave's killer bread 'good seed'-both
  made here in oregon. conveniently, my homemade strawberry jam i made back in
  july was a winning combination with the cheese and bread.
