  I took an apple bread recipe and have slowly modified it hoping for a slightly
  healthier version.  my kids love eating this bread and it's fantastic slightly
  warm with a bit of real butter.  mmm mmm!!  i love how quick and easy this is
  to make too!

 - Cool the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes
