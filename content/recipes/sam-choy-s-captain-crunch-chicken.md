  Taken from hawaiinewsnow.com. time to marinate is not included in prep/cook
  time. posted for zwt. eta: i have now made this chicken, tho i used boneless
  skinless breasts, as it is what i had on hand. the cap'n crunch cereal makes a
  tasty breading, and the marinade imparts a nice underlying flavor.
