description: >-
  Consider keeping the jalapeno seeds and membranes, otherwise the results will
  be good, but mild.  also, remember to use disposable latex gloves when
  handling peppers.  i can't guarantee the recipe should you reduce the sugar
  because i've never made it otherwise.  sure-jell premium (yellow box) requires
  a certain amount of sugar to gel properly.  (i do have another jalapeno jelly
  recipe, recipe #460242.  it's considerably less work and equally divine.) 
  btw, should any recipe fail, see recipe #151544.

 - Sterilize eight half pint canning jars with lids and rings , boiling for at least 5 minutes and kept hot
 - Place the crushed strawberries , processed jalapeno pepper , lemon juice and pectin into a large , heavy-bottomed saucepan
 - Stir in the sugar to dissolve
 - Rapidly bring to a boil over high heat
 - Once at a full rolling boil , cook for 1 full minute
 - One half teaspoon butter may be added to keep down the foam , if desired
 - Letting this mixture sit for about 5 minutes discourages the fruit from separating
 - Pack the jam into the hot , sterilized jars , filling the jars to within 1 / 4 inch of the top
 - Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles
 - Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue
 - Top with lids and screw on rings
 - Process 10 minutes in a boiling water canner
 - Remove the jars and place onto a cloth-covered or heat-resistance surface
