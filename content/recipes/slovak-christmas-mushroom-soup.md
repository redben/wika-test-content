description: "This is a family tradition to be made on christmas eve.  if you love sauerkraut, you'll love this soup.  tart and delicious.  simple to make and smells heavenly.  it can be very hard to find cans of straight sauerkraut juice, which is probably why it's such a coveted recipe and we only get it once a year.  (if we're lucky enough to find the juice)  \r\nthis soup is supposed to bring you good luck for the upcoming new year!  happy cooking!\r\n*note:\r\nthis is a handed down recipe and therefore i don't always have exact measurements, what is listed below is how my aunt and i made the recipe*"
