  Trust me. follow my method. you won't be disappointed! serving beef
  tenderloin, otherwise known as filet of beef or filet mignon, is an expensive
  dish but keep this in mind: there is absolutely no waste if it's trimmed
  properly, it's delicious, easy to make, and it will wow your guests every
  time. we like our meat cooked perfectly medium rare and not a spec more! i
  have adjusted the cooking times for a fool proof roast every time. instead of
  a whole tenderloin, this time, i bought 2, 4.5 pound cuts. i think it's easier
  to handle 2 smaller cuts that are the same size in diameter.
