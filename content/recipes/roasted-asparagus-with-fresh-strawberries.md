description: "From strawberrysue.com.\r\ngrand prize winner, home cook division.\r\nrecipe submitted by barbara estabrook, rhinelander, wisconsin.\r\n\r\nthis sounds like a weird combination of flavors, but it is so good! we used maple bacon instead of applewood-smoked because it's all we had on-hand, but it was great! we also used plain feta instead of feta with peppercorns and it was just fine."
