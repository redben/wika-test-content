description: >-
  This is a very pretty and healthy salad with a slight tang from the grapefruit
  and not a lot of dressing. this is a low sodium heart healthy salad. the
  splenda/sugar will need adjusting depending on how much tangy you would like
  this salad to have. the 30 minute chill time is not included.
