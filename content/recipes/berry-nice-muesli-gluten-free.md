description: >-
  Copycat version of wildtime foods' muesli. all ingredient amounts are
  estimated and you are welcomed and encouraged to play around with the
  proportions. note: the eden company manufactures brown rice flakes and they
  are not to be confused or are the same as cereal flakes (cornflakes, for
  example). they look very similar to oats. you'll find brown rice flakes in
  your local natural food store or online. if you're really lucky, some stores
  may carry them in the bulk bins.
