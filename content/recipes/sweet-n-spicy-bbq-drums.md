description: "These drums are finger licking good.  the flavor is in the barbeque sauce and like most homemade sauces, this one is tastier if used the following day.  allowing the flavors to blend overnight really enhances the flavor.  i personally used 1 1/3 cups of the sauce on the drums,  feel free to use as much or as little as you desire.  \r\n \r\nplease note: prep time is the time required to make the bbq sauce, chilling time is not included."
