  I found this on the food channel site (australian) and made this today for
  visitors tonight. i don't have a mixer with a dough hook, so kneaded it  on my
  bench top for 20 minutes. it was very sticky but a tiny bit of flour sprinkled
  over the bench made it very easy to work.

 - Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 125 ml of the warm water and set aside in a warm place for about 10 minutes until frothy
 - Use your fingers to work 90g of the flour into the yeast to make a sloppy paste
 - Sprinkle lightly with a little more flour , then cover with a tea towel and set aside in a warm place for 30 minutes to form a sponge
 - Put the remaining flour and the salt into a large bowl
 - Make a well in the centre and add the sponge , oil and remaining water
 - Use your fingers to work it to a soft , sloppy dough
 - Dont panic: it is meant to be very sticky !
 - Transfer to an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead on a low speed for 1015 minutes until very smooth and springy
 - Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl , then cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest at room temperature for 1 hour or until doubled in size
 - When ready to bake the bread , preheat the oven to its highest setting with two pizza stones or oiled baking sheets in it
 - Divide the dough in two , then form into rounds and leave , covered , to rest for 30 minutes
 - Mix the egg and milk to make an egg wash
 - Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface
 - Use the heels of your hands to press and flatten each piece of dough out to a 20 cm oval
 - Brush the surface liberally with the egg wash
 - Dip your finger
 - Now comes the tricky bit
 - Lightly flour the hot pizza stones or trays
 - Lift on the pides , stretching them gently and evenly
 - Sprinkle with nigella or sesame seeds and bake for 810 minutes until crisp and golden brown
