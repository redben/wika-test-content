  A recipe i am posting for zwt6.  this is one of the easiest recipes to make,
  and one of the most tempting to eat. adjust the garlic down if it's not a
  favorite, and the classic tastes of lemon and oregano will still make this
  dish uniquely greek.  i put a little change on this recipe, by decreasing the
  amount of olive oil by half and adding the 1/4 cup of butter for more flavor. 
  update: 7/23/2011, i have now made this for dh and myself, so only made 1/2 of
  the recipe.  we loved this recipe, so simple and a no fuss meal.  i used small
  red skinned potatoes that i just cut in half, they didn't need the full
  cooking time, so added them in about an hour before it was done.
