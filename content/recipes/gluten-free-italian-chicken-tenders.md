  I was making gluten-free cajun buffalo chicken tenders the other night and
  knew that they might be a bit to spicy for the kids. so i decided to make some
  italian chicken tenders too. i hope you enjoy this simple and tasty dish. for
  those who do not have an issue with gluten all purpose flour can be used.
