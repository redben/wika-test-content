  Simple and fabulous. recipe found in food network magazine nov 2010.  this
  could easily be made vegan by using vegan margarine which is what i did.  the
  first time i made it i made it as is and loved it.  second time i added chinks
  of butternut squash and used walnuts in place of pine nuts and then topped it
  with manchego shavings.....delish!  we eat this as a main course.
