  I have researched and tried many different variations. mysterygirl's recipe
  was as close as i could find. i started with her recipe and made a few
  changes, i believe the key to it is the cumin seed. when added, that seemed to
  make the difference. follow this exactly and i believe you will be pleasantly
  surprised.
