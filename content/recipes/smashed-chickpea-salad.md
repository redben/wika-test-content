 - Mix everything but the olive oil in a small to midsize bowl
 - Very lightly smash the chickpea mixture with the back of a fork or a potato masher
 - You're not looking for a hummus-like puree but something closer to a coarse chop with a few smaller bits to hold it together
 - Add the glugs of olive oil , mix it lightly and enjoy
