  says of this recipe, “this eggless cake is called a one pan cake because
  everything is mixed together in the baking pan. it makes for easy cleanup.”
  variation: to make 14 whoopie pie halves, double the recipe except for the
  water. drop ¼ cup batter on a baking sheet lined with wax paper and bake for
  about 20 minutes.
