  This a great pan- sear pork chop made with no egg mixture. most times you dip
  in the egg and then dredge. we needed one without egg and this fits the bill.
  it is geared to be a how to for the newer cook. being a basic recipe it can be
  altered to suit anyone's taste. i feed the kids these chops made this way and
  they gobble them up-no convincing needed. enjoy! chefdlh
