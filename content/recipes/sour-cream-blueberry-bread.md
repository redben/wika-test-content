description: "This dessert bread puts boring ole' banana bread to shame for sure! \r\n\r\nthis recipe is amazing. the use of bananas/sour cream makes it as light as cake, and the sweetness of the bananas and sugar gives it a delightfully light and crunchy crust. i tried it when full and almost had an entire half-loaf. \r\n\r\nonly use fresh or frozen blueberries(they won't burst or go runny in this bread!), not dried. mine were days old, but this recipe still brought them back to life! i don't have a food process, so i make the \"banana pulp\" using a fork and my hands. i also prefer (emerald brand) glazed pecans, fist-crushed(but only slightly) in a ziplock, b/c normal ones taste too woody and drab for my taste. \r\n\r\nanother winner from williams-sonoma!\r\n\r\n*makes one 9-by-5-inch loaf*"
