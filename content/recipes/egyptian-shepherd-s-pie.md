  Every week i cook a dish from a different country just to keep things
  interesting.  i came across this recipe in my search for an egyptian meal that
  wasn't too exotic for our tastes but would still bring something new and tasty
  to the table.  well, it was a hit with my family and i figured i'd put it out
  there in an easier to access forum for anyone else looking to try something a
  little different.  if you use 2lbs of fresh sweet potato you can cut down on
  some of the extra sweetness that comes from using canned sweet potatoes.  i've
  done it both ways and prefer the fresh myself.  you can make whatever
  adjustments that suit you.  i hope you enjoy it as much as my family does.
