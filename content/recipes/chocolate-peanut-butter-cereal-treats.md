description: >-
  These are not your typical cereal treats.  the marshmallow mixture that holds
  these goodies together is lightly flavored with peanut butter and chocolate,
  and the cereal used is a mixture of cocoa krispies and honey bunches of oats. 
  frankly, i used honey bunches of oats simply because i ran out of rice
  krispies, but i'm enjoying the finished product much better this way.  my
  family gives it eight thumbs up, and i hope yours likes it too!
