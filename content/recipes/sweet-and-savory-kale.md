  I bought a large bag of kale and this recipe was on the back. i tried it and
  really enjoyed the sauce. i opted to leave out the almonds and cranberries,
  but it would be nice to dress it up. enjoy! this will work with collards and
  other greens too. kale is very high in beta carotene, vitamin k, vitamin c,
  lutein, zeaxanthin, and reasonably rich in calcium. developed in europe, it is
  used in england, italy, ireland, germany, the netherlands, scotland, east
  africa, denmark, sweden, montenegro, russia and even japan. during world war
  ii, the cultivation of kale in the u.k. was encouraged by the dig for victory
  campaign. the vegetable was easy to grow and provided important nutrients to
  supplement those missing from a normal diet because of rationing.  kale was
  introduced into canada (and then into the u.s.) by russian traders in the 19th
  century.
