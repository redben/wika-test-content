 - If you're using dried orange or lemon rind like me , place 2 1 / 4 tsp dried rind and 6 3 / 4 teaspoons water in a bowl and let stand for 15 minutes to hydrate
 - Bring the water to a boil
 - Add the salt , rind , earth balance , turmeric , and cardamom and mix well before adding the rice
 - Make sure the rice is covered , then lower the heat to a simmer and loosely cover
 - Cook for 45-50 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the water and steam and is soft and fluffy
 - Mix the peas in with the cooked rice , cover and let sit for 5 minutes so they can absorb the steam
 - Stir and serve
