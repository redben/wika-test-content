  Entered for safekeeping, from ny times magazine, 11/10/13.  if you haven't
  tried sriracha sauce, i heartily endorse it, and i don't eat fiery food.  it
  lends a tangy flavor, and you can control how much you use.  that gob of mayo
  makes this so american!  (personally i would scrape a fine layer of mayo on
  the toast, but if the honey-sriracha sauce is too fiery, then increase the
  mayo.)  this is on my short list to try for myself.
