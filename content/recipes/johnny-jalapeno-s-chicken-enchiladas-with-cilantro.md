  Sittin around the campfire one night, rickymac of the mcdaniel gang told us a
  story of how one day johnny went down to the swimmin hole and was having fun
  all day swingin from the rope tree into the water, cowboy boots and all!.
  well, that last dip he come up from the water with the strangest look on his
  face. he yelled "there's a snake in my boot!" he jumped outta them boots and
  took off runnin like a chicken. he run so fast, he run right through a field
  of cilantro. when he came into a clearing, feeling safe at last, he stopped,
  looked down at his feet, and said "look!, i got cilan-toes! hence: this
  chicken with cilan-toes recipe was born!
