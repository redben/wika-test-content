  From the blog "surfing the world cuisine". the name derives from the taurus
  mountain range that stretches from antalaya to adana, and in turkey it is
  served typically with kebabs. i thought it was very fresh tasting and good
  with grilled meat. i've adapted the recipe somewhat, as there were no
  quantities given for some ingredients.

 - Wash and dry the herbs and greens
 - The easiest way to get the parsley leaves is to take the bunch and hold it leaves down
 - Take a sharp knife and chop it down along the stems
 - The leaves will separate from the stems very nicely
 - Gather them together and chop finely
 - I had about 3 cups chopped parsley
 - Transfer to medium bowl
 - Finely chop the dill , mint and arugula
 - I used rather less mint
 - I also used watercress instead of arugula , as there was none at the market
 - Add to bowl
 - Add the chopped and seeded tomatoes
 - In a small bowl , whisk together all the dressing ingredients
 - Drizzle over the salad and gently toss to coat
 - Sprinkle the pomegranate seeds over all , if using
