 - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees
 - Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil
 - I spray it with non-stick cooking spray like pam to help with the sticking , and of course you can always use more butter
 - Place the crackers side by side on the tray forming a large rectangle
 - This will make the caramel and chocolate easier to spread
 - Over high heat , combine the butter and brown sugar in a saucepan
 - Stirring constantly , bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes after boiling
 - Pour caramel mixture over crackers and spread evenly to the edges
 - I use an offset spatula for this
 - Bake for 5 minutes , pull out and sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the crackers
 - Bake for 3 minutes more , pull out and spread the softened chocolate chips evenly over the caramel
 - Change the oven setting to a high broil
 - Then sprinkle the pecans evenly over all and place back in the oven for up to a minute -- but you really have to stand by and watch since all broilers differ
 - Be careful or you will burn your nuts :)
 - Chill in the freezer for 15 minutes or until set
 - Peel the foil away and break into pieces
 - Store in a covered , airtight container in the refrigerator
