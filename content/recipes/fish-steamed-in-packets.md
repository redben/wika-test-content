 - Preheat oven to 425 degrees
 - Tear 4 lengths of parchment paper or foil , each about 18 inches long
 - Fold each length across in half and unfold
 - On 1 / 2 of each piece of paper place 1 / 4 of the fish
 - Top each piece of fish with 1 / 4 of the scallions
 - Whisk together the sesame oil , rice vinegar , soy sauce and honey until the honey is dissolved
 - Drizzle over the fish
 - Sprinkle with sesame seeds
 - Crimp or fold over the edges to form a sealed packet
 - Repeat forming 4 packets
 - Place them on 2 baking sheets
 - Bake in the center of the oven for about 13 minutes , depending on the thickness of the fish , until the packets are puffed
 - Remove from the oven and transfer a packet to each plate
 - Cut the top of the packets and open carefully to avoid the escaping steam and serve the fish in the open packets
 - Or , if you serve the fish with a side dish that will benefit from the addition of the tasty fish juice , empty the fish and sauce onto your plate !
