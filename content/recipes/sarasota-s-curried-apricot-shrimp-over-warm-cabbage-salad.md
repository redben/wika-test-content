  Wonderful grilled shrimp over a warm cabbage salad. a quick easy 1-2 hr
  marinade for the shrimp and then grilled. pan grilled inside is fine, but if
  possible an outdoor grill is best. a quick saute of the salad dressing and
  tossed with the cabbage makes for a great salad base for this dish. i serve
  the grilled shrimp over the salad with fresh fruit on the side for a  perfect
  family dinner. my son loves this, but he always asks for rice, so i make a
  jasmine or basmati rice with some scallions and cooked in broth and serve that
  on the side to make him happy. special note: i admit, i never liked recipes
  with ramen noodles, but this actually does work - it is a very good salad.

 - Shrimp marinade -- in a large baggie , add the oil , apricot preserves , dijon mustard , curry powder , and garlic and let marinade 1-2 hours
 - No longer
 - Thirty minutes to me is the minimum for great flavor
 - Rice -- my son likes rice with this dish , so that is an option , i enjoy the shrimp right over the salad
 - But if you want rice
 - Now is the time to make it
 - The shrimp and salad both take very little time to make
 - Salad -- prepare your salad
 - Add the cabbage to a large bowl along with the scallions , water chestnuts , zucchini , and onions
 - Crunch -- in a small non-stick skillet , add 1 teaspoon butter and bring to medium / medium high heat
 - Add the almonds and ramen noodles and cook until golden brown , 1-2 minutes
 - Remove to a small plate lined with a paper towel to let cool a few minutes
 - Shrimp -- the shrimp is marinated and ready to grill
 - Use whatever method you like
 - I have grilled them both inside and also outside using my vegetable basket and they both work great
 - You can broil too
 - Salt and pepper well and then grill on medium high heat until the shrimp begin to curl and turn pink
 - Don't over cook , they will only take a couple of minutes per side
 - Two minutes , flip two more and they will be done , remove and cover with foil
 - Extra large or jumbo may take a few more minutes , but not much
 - As the shrimp cooks , make the dressing
 - Dressing -- in that same pan as you cooked those noodles and almonds in , add the oil , sugar , apricot preserves , vinegar and bring to a boil for just a minute no more
 - Remove from the heat and slowly add the soy sauce
 - Finish -- add most of the dressing to the salad and toss well
 - Depending on the size of the cabbage and how much dressing you like , you may not use it all
 - You can easily save it for another night
 - Then add in the cooled almonds and ramen noodle mixture and toss again
 - Top the warm salad with the shrimp and serve on a platter family style
 - Option , as i said my son likes rice too with this and you can serve this right along the side which makes a great dinner
