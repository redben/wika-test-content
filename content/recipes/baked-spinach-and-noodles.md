description: >-
  This was inspired by another recipe i tried here, but by the time i made
  changes to make it healthier and to accommodate what was in my fridge, it
  really was a completely different recipe. it is a cross between the noodle
  kugel i grew up with, mac & cheese (minus the cheese) and baked creamed
  spinach.
