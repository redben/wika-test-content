description: "From the pioneer woman: \"serve these to the people you love (that can include yourself, if applicable) when they’re on their way out the door. the dijon absolutely makes these little numbers, but you can switch up the kind of cheese you use…and if you need a little spice in your life, throw in some cayenne pepper! they’ll start your day off just right.\r\n\r\nenjoy these! they’re yummy.\""
