description: >-
  This is such a wonderful old recipe! fresh butter is mixed with floral scented
  waters, such as rose water or orange blossom water and is delicious as an
  alternative to clotted cream, especially when spread on freshly made scones.
  it is also wonderful with all types of griddle cakes, crumpets and traditional
  tea cakes and breads.  this floral butter dates back to the 18th century and
  is featured in mrs beeton's book of household management, as well as numerous
  other historical cookbooks. this recipe adapts well to modern cooking - and
  would make a stunning feature at any victorian style ladies' afternoon tea
  party or even a little girl's birthday party. serve this with pancakes for
  breakfast or brunch, the possibilities are endless!

 - Pound the cooked egg yolks with the floral water , and the icing sugar
 - Make a fine paste with all of the ingredients
 - Add the egg yolk mixture with the softened butter and mix thoroughly
 - When it is well mixed and smooth , allow the butter to firm up in a cool place or the fridge
 - Take the block of firm fairy butter and push it through a sieve , so that the little "fairy" pieces of butter fall in a loose heap on to a pretty serving plate
 - I have also used a tea strainer
 - It is smaller and easy to use
 - If you are making a large batch , you can also use a potato ricer
 - Serve the fairy butter in a pretty dish and serve with hot scones , pancakes , griddle cakes , toast , crumpets , traditional tea cakes and loaves
