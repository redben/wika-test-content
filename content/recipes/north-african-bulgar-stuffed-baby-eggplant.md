  time so what you see here is a guess, take your best shot.

 - "preheat the oven to 375f
 - Cut each baby eggplant in half , keeping the stem end intact and going straight to the tail
 - Use one tablespoon of oil to brush liberally over the eggplants , both front and back , before laying them cut side up on a baking sheet
 - Tuck the oiled eggplant halves in the oven for approximately 20 minutes , or until the flesh is soft and easily pierced with a fork but the bodies have not collapsed
 - While the eggplant are baking up , its a perfect time to toast the pine nuts
 - Spread the nuts out on an ungreased baking sheet in a single layer
 - Tuck them in the oven for 3-5 minutes , shaking the pan halfway through
 - When the pine nuts are mostly golden brown they are toasted and ready
 - Shake the nuts off the pan and into a bowl so that they do not continue cooking with the ambient heat
 - Cooking the bulghar is as easy as can be
 - Put it into a heatproof container and pour the boiling water over top
 - Sprinkle liberally with salt and let it stand for 15 minutes
 - The grain will start to soak up that hot , salty water and rehydrate , becoming tender and fluffy
 - You could let the bulghar soak for as long as 30 minutes , but i like to drain it after 15 so that it is still a touch al dente
 - After all , when the bulgar is added to the tomato mixture and baked it will continue to soak up moisture so it shouldnt be mushy soft
 - The nuts are toasted , the eggplant is baking , and the bulghar is soaking
 - Life is pretty good
 - Chop the onions into a small , thin mince and finely mince the garlic
 - Put the aromatics in a large saucepan , along with the remaining two tablespoons of oil , and set it over medium heat
 - Starting the onions and garlic off in a cold pan will encourage them to deepen and sweeten without as much risk of burning
 - After 5-7 minutes when the onions are a pale gold color add the diced tomatoes , honey and dried spices
 - Okay , so i totally didnt use diced tomatoes here
 - I used whole canned tomatoes , because i love to squish them into a pulp in my hands before adding them to the pan
 - We all have our quirky little habits , and that just happens to be one of mine
 - Give this a stir and turn the heat down slightly to medium low
 - You will need to cook the tomato mixture for at least 7-10 minutes , stirring fairly regularly , or until the liquid has reduced significantly in the pan
 - Are the eggplants soft ? as soon as they are cool enough to handle , use a small paring knife to score all around the edges of the eggplant , leaving a skin which is about 1 / 4 thick
 - Carefully scoop out the flesh which needs to be given a good chop
 - When the tomato mixture has thickened enough that you can run a spoon through it and still see the bottom of the pan 5 seconds later , add the chopped eggplant flesh and stir it through
 - Let this cook for a minute or two so that the flavors can combine
 - Finely chop the mint and parsley leaves
 - There should be slightly more mint than parsley , but be generous with both
 - Reserve one tablespoon of the chopped herbs to use as garnish
 - Take the pan off the heat before adding the bulgar to the tomatoes , along with the pine nuts , mint and parsley
 - Stir everything together , squeeze in the juice of 1 / 2 lemon , and season quite generously with salt and pepper
 - You cant afford to be shy with the seasoning in a bulgar dish
 - Spoon the stuffing into your gutted eggplant halves , pressing it together and really mounding it inches your cupped palm is the best tool that you could have to keep the mixture in a pseudo-dome shape as you press it into the shells
 - Bake the eggplant for 15-20 minutes , or until they are warmed through and the tops are just starting to brown
 - Sprinkle the eggplant with your reserved chopped parsley and mint , and serve with a bowl of black olives and some fresh pita bread on the side
 - The sultry cinnamon and allspice , combined with smoky nutmeg and just a mere whiff of heat from the chili are enough to elevate a simple bulgar and tomato stuffing into the realm of the exotic in a non-intimidating way
 - Light , clean , healthy and vegetarian dinners are always easier than i expect
 - In fact , im rather looking forward to putting the chicken breasts aside again a few days from now
