  I found this on the domino sugar brand website.  boy what a great muffin
  recipe.  i looked on this site and most did not use this amount of peanut
  butter.  i think you could exchange the creamy peanut butter for crunchy but i
  end up using chopped roasted peanuts too so that is accounted for in this
  recipe.  if you want to skip that step then just use crunchy peanut butter. 
  they suggested a glaze of chocolate icing but i find that is too sweet and we
  like these as more of a snack and not a dessert.  hope you enjoy.
