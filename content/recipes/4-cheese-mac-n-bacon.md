description: >-
  This is based on a popular dish at t's restaurant in chicago. but i modified
  what i tasted and added a touch of bacon to really give it some heartiness.
  whoever you serve this to will immediately declare it the best mac 'n' cheese
  they've ever had. unite against boxed mac 'n' cheese!
