  This is one of hubby's favorite greek foods, but as in any ethnic family, it's
  tough for an outsider (especially a non-greek outsider!) to compete.  ok, so
  this one is not as good as sil athena's pastitsio (admittedly the best i've
  ever had) but it's as close as i'm going to come!  even vasilly says it's
  very, very good...
