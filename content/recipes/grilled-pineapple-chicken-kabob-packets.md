  From betty crocker, this island-y recipe sounds wonderful and gets good
  reviews.  posting here to try later as i couldn't find it already on the
  site.  "this new twist takes the work out of kabobs. instead of skewering the
  vegetables and meat and brushing with the glaze, they are combined in a simple
  packet and grilled."
