description: "Growing up in los angeles, i loved the delicious authentic mexican cuisine.  carnitas has always been one of my favorite dishes and unfortunately, you just don't get the same quality carnitas in portland that you would in los angeles.  so, i thought i would share my recipe for delicious, mouth-watering carnitas.  it's not quite authentic or traditional mexican style carnitas  since i slow cook instead of lard fry the meat, but i hope you'll appreciate the health benefits. :d\r\n\r\nthis recipe makes a huge quantity so you can use the meat in a variety of ways.   fantastic in enchiladas, tacos, spaghetti sauce, or just served plain with rice."

 - Trim large chunks of fat from the pork shoulder , but leave some fat on for flavor
 - Cut pork shoulder into large chunks
 - I usually cut them to about half the size of my fist
 - In a large pot , add the oil to the bottom of the pan and brown the pork
 - Add in the ground herbs while browning the pork
 - Once pork is browned , add the first bottle of beer
 - Using a wooden or silicone spoon , scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen the delicious browned bits
 - Add the remaining ingredients to the pot , cover and slow cook for 3-4 hours on low heat or until pork is tender and falling apart
 - Preheat oven to 350 degrees
 - Remove pork from pot and place into a foil-lined , large baking pan
 - Do not discard the liquid stock
 - Turn the pot with the liquid stock to high heat to reduce the amount of liquid
 - Using two forks , shred the pork in the pan completely
 - Add in reserve cilantro
 - Pour enough of the liquid stock into the pan to halfway cover the pork
 - Return pot to heat
 - Place pork in oven
 - Check pork every 15 minutes or so , turning gently and adding liquid stock until all the stock has been used
 - Remove pork from oven when there is almost no liquid left in the pan
 - Serve and enjoy !
