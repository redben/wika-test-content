description: >-
  When i was last back in england, i bought a bag of semi-dried mixed summer
  berries; strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, bilberries (wild
  blueberries) and cherries, all semi-dried and bursting with colour and
  flavour. i could not wait to cook with them, having sampled a few of them
  first of course! i came up with this recipe, a simple classic scone recipe,
  the mainstay of all english tea tables and they simply flew off the table,
  with requests for the recipe. the stars of the show are the semi-dried
  berries, and a good home-made jam and cream of course. use any semi-dried
  berries you can source locally, but do try to replicate the summer berries i
  have listed, for that optimum flavour sensation!
