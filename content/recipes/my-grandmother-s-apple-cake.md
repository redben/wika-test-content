 - Preheat the oven to 350f melt the butter in a small saucepan or in a non-metallic bowl set in the microwave
 - Grease a nonstick 8-inch round cake pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter using a pastry brush or paper towel
 - Combine the flour , baking powder , and salt in a small mixing bowl
 - Wash , peel , and core the apples
 - Cut them in eighths and arrange over the bottom of the pan
 - In a medium mixing bowl , whisk the sugar with the eggs until fluffy
 - Add the flour mixture and whisk until combined
 - Add the melted butter and whisk again until blended
 - Pour the batter evenly over the fruit and bake for 40 minutes , until the top is set and golden brown
 - Let the cake settle on a cooling rack for 10 minutes
 - Run a knife around the pan to loosen and flip the cake onto a plate
 - If any piece of fruit has stuck to the bottom of the pan , scrape it off carefully and place it back on the cake where it belongs
 - Flip the cake again onto a serving plate - work cautiously so as not to squish the cake between the two plates
 - Let cool and serve slightly warm or at room temperature
