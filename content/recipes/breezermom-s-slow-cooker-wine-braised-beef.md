  Essentially, this is recipe #482673 by chef #226863 that i adapted for the
  slow cooker.  it lends itself to that method of preparation beautifully, and
  the result is a flavorful, tender beef dish that is very delicious.  as in the
  original recipe, i did not include the marinating time in the prep time, so
  prepare accordingly.
