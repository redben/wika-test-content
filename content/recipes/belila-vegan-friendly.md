  Cooked wheat berries in milk from egypt. please take into consideration the
  time necessary to soak the wheat berries overnight and to cook them for one
  hour. good for either breakfast or dessert but we enjoyed it better as the
  former. wheat berries have quite a chewy texture so if you've never cooked
  with them before at least you know what to expect. as found in the cookbook
  'mediterranean light' by martha rose shulman. vegan friendly.
