description: >-
  Printed in the july 2011 issue of sunset magazine. if marionberries are
  unavailable, use blackberries although other berries will work: raspberry,
  strawberry, blueberry, etc. i was very lucky to have heirloom organic 'black
  cap' raspberries on hand to test in this pie recipe. there weren't enough of
  the 'black caps' to make a full pie though and i ended up baking a mini-pie.
  note: for {{frozen}} berries, measure, thaw until somewhat softened, and use
  all juices.
