description: "My aunt avis loves to entertain in her beautiful home overlooking the atlantic ocean. she's given me lots of great recipes that my own guests rave about. this easy, elegant and decadent finger food is one of my favorites. garlic puffs also make a great snack, a side dish for pasta and soups, or a rich replacement for croutons in a ceasar salad. \r\n\r\nstock up your freezer so you always have some on hand. they will store for several months in a zip locked freezer bag, but they probably won't last that long! set up an assembly line with your egg dip and melted butter, and be ready to get your hands dirty. (these are worth it!)\r\n\r\nsome tips; be sure to use flavourful garlic butter in this recipe - that's key to a tasty result. i usually add both fresh garlic and a pinch of garlic salt. don't buy expensive parm - you can use the less expensive variety sold in plastic shakers."
