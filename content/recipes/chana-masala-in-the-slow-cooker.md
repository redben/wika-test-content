  Ever since a new indian restaurant opened up in our town last fall, i can't
  get enough.  it's become my new foodie obsession.  for me, it wasn't enough to
  just enjoy a nice meal out every other month.  i wanted to recreate these
  colorful flavors at home.  if you're new to indian cooking, don't let these
  recipes overwhelm you.  just because the list of ingredients is longer than
  usual, it doesn't mean they're difficult or expensive.  it's true, you may
  have to spend a little bit on your initial investment in indian cookery. 
  garam masala, turmeric, and other spices are a must, and they can set you back
  $5-7 per bottle.  however, they last a long time and ensure the authentic
  flavors of india.  plus, most of the other ingredients required are
  inexpensive and help offset the cost of the spices.  this recipe for one of my
  favorites, chana masala, is so flavorful you'll forget that it's
  vegetarian...and frugal!
