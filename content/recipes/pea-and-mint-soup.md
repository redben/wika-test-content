  This is a simple, delicious soup that can be served either hot or cold. adding
  ham is optional. note the chopping of veggies in the ingredient section. once
  everything is prepped, the soup comes together in a snap! this soup goes well
  with a nice piece of crusty bread...or toasted bread drizzled with a little
  bit of olive oil. thanks go to jamie oliver!

 - Pour the broth into a medium saucepan and heat until boiling
 - In a separate , large saucepan on medium heat , add 2 t
 - Of olive oil
 - Add the prepped carrots , celery , onions and garlic and mix together
 - Put a lid on , slightly off center so some steam can escape
 - Cook this for about 10 minutes , until the carrots are tender but still holding their shape and the onions are golden
 - Add the boiling broth to the veggies
 - Add the peas
 - Stir and bring to a boil
 - Once boiling , bring the soup to a simmer
 - Simmer for about 10 minutes , until peas are softened
 - Take the pan off the heat and season with salt and pepper and add some mint leaves
 - Jamie says to use a small bunch
 - I think this is a matter of personal taste , in terms of how much mint flavor you like to shine through
 - Start out small and increase until your taste buds are pleased ! i added about half a bunch of chopped mint and thought it was enough for my tastes
 - Using an immersion blender , blend the soup until smooth
 - Optional:
 - If you are using ham , chop it up into bite-size pieces and stir it into the blended soup
 - Heat the soup through before serving or let it cool , store it in your fridge and eat it cold anytime you'd like !
