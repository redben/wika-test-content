  I based this recipe on the followin site:
  (http://www.pickyourown.org/watermelonjelly.htm)   it worked fine for me. i
  know that when working with pectin, especially the liquid kind, the results
  can be iffy. i made double batches of this jelly and both times there was no
  problem with it jelling. i experimented with watermelon preserves and had a
  lot of the red fruit left over that i couldn't eat before it went bad. this is
  how i used up the whole watermelon, jelly and rind preserves. this jelly is so
  good to me!

 - Prepare jars and lids by boiling in water for about 10 minutes
 - Using the red part of the watermelon , remove the seeds and cube
 - Place in a blender or food processor and blend well
 - The four cups of cubed watermelon should yield 2 cups of juice / puree , add or remove juice to equal 2 cups
 - At this point the juice can be strained , i don't strain my juice
 - Juice lemons to get 3 tablespoons , fresh squeezed is best
 - Bottled is not as good tasting but will work
 - Add the zest of one lemon to the lemon juice , the amount of zest is approximate for a lemon , set aside
 - The zest can be optional , so don't worry about it if you are using bottled lemon juice
 - In a separate container mix 1 / 2 cup of white granulated sugar with the package of dry no sugar pectin , i use 100% natural sure jell premium fruit pectin
 - Open another box , measure and add 1 tablespoon additional , mix sugar and pectin well , set aside
 - Measure out the other 3 cups of sugar in a separate container , and set it aside , close to the cooking area
 - Pour the 2 cups of watermelon juice / puree into a large stainless steel pot
 - Add 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and zest to the watermelon juice
 - Stir in the sugar pectin mixture and bring to a hard boil
 - The heat will be on medium high to high at this point
 - I like to use a whisk to constantly stir the mixture until it boils
 - Reaching the boiling stage should take between 5-10 minutes , keep stirring
 - Add the remaining 3 cups of sugar and bring back to a hard boil , stirring or whisking constantly for about 1-2 minutes
 - Remove from heat
 - Fill prepared jars about 1 / 4 inch from the top
 - Wipe the rim of jars and place lids and rings to the jars
 - Seal in prepared jars , approximately 1 / 2 pint jars , 1 / 4 pint jars , or pint jars
 - Place filled jars in a boiling hot water bath with about 1 inch of water covering the top of the jars
 - If you do not have a canner use a large stock pot with a towel in the bottom
 - Do not let the jars touch
 - Boil gently for about 10 minutes
 - Remove jars and set away from draft to cool
 - I place towel lined cookie sheet in the cold oven and let the jars cool in the oven with the door closed
 - Make sure that the jars have sealed before storing
 - The jelly is good for about 12 months , but is best the first 6 months
 - The color and consistency may change the longer it is stored
 - Use as you would with any other jelly , this is a great icing for a yellow cake
 - Optional: if you are making several batches and you want them a little different , add whole spices
