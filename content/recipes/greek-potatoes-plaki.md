 - Over medium heat pour oil into a medium size pot and sautee the onion until they are clear in apperance
 - Add the garlic and continue to sautee for another 5 minute
 - Next add the tomato sauce , potatoes , water , parsley and black pepper
 - Mix well cover and stir occasionally very gently until potatoes are tender
 - This recipe is even better if you cook it a day ahead
 - I have found that when reheating the potates the next day the flavor is richer !
