  This cafe venitzio cocktail is italian through and through. amaretto and
  galliano team up to bring you a little taste of italy to warm your hands as
  well as your heart. you can add any kind of coffee, but it should be not
  surprise that  a lovely italian roast is recommended. enjoy! (based on the
  lonely review, i would guess that this drink might be more appealing with
  either amaretto or galliano... and some whipped cream!)
