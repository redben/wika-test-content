  Easy tapas with lots of flavour! this is a great way to make chicken skewers
  with veggies! normally when you put everything on the skewers raw, the veggies
  are way overcooked by the time the chicken is cooked through. don't let the
  ingredients fool you - they are pantry staples. please note the 3 hour
  marinating time. this delicious recipe is courtesy of michell perez. enjoy!
