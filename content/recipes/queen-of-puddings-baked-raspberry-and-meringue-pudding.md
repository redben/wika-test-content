description: >-
  This is probably one of the lightest and most mouth-watering puddings ever
  invented. this delightful old fashioned british "pud" consists of layers of
  baked custard, raspberry jam and is finished with clouds of light, fluffy
  meringue - truly a queen in the pudding world. it is a quintessential nursery
  dessert, something that nanny would rustle up for her young charges in the
  nursery. my mum would often make this for sunday high tea, and we all loved
  it. i often use brioche crumbs for a richer custard base, but any white bread
  crumbs will be fine. there are numerous recipes for this classic dessert; this
  recipe is by james martin, one of my favourite british chefs.
