title: Crockpot Split Pea Lentil And Barley Soup Aka Weight Watchers
date: 2010-11-18T00:00:00.000Z
description: "I made split pea and barley soup and was left with only a little bit of each left. i made lentil soup, and was left with only a little bit of the bag left. i really, really wanted split pea soup tonight, so i decided to put a little bit of each in and see how it goes. i also added some turkey pepperoni instead of ham (so feel free to use whatever smoky meat you want) because...i didn't have any ham! the outcome was something unexpectedly delicious, and i think i'll be making this quite a bit in the future!\r\n\r\nby the way, each portion of this is 6 very filling weight watchers points (recalculating for the new system) without the turkey pepperoni. with the turkey pepperoni, it's 7."
