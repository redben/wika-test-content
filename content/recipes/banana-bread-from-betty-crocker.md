description: >-
  This is the recipe i always use for banana bread.  it is very forgiving and
  you can add more nuts, more bananas (just adjust the milk quantity so the
  batter has the consistency of muffin batter), and only need one bowl.  i use
  walnuts usually, but pecans are good too and i usually use the cheap 'whole
  and pieces' nuts without chopping further.
