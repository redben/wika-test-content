title: Spicy Lime Pollock Keto Version
date: 2011-09-10T00:00:00.000Z
description: "This dish has an excellent flavor and is quick and easy to make. any fish filet works just fine for this recipe (flounder, tilapia, sole, pollack, haddock) and the combination of the high heat and the aluminum foil packets steams the veggies to perfection. i often put the packets together up to a day ahead of time, and pop them in the oven when i get home from work to let them marinate a bit.\r\n\r\nthis is portioned out for my husband and i for a keto diet (9 grams of net carbs per serving using usda calculations, not sure why it's a bit higher here)."
