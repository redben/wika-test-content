description: >-
  Try this soft fruity pumpkin cake. when i saw the contest ingredients that
  could be used in baked goods, orange and pumpkin immediately came to mind to
  tie them all together. what i came up with is extra special for you to bake
  and give to family and friends during the holidays. you can easily make this
  in 12 muffin tins or double it in a bundt pan. for gift giving, mini loaf pans
  are nice. i’m giving you a choice of 3 delicious toppings: dust with
  confectioner’s sugar, frost it with neufchatel frosting or ice it with white
  chocolate icing. or you can make multiple loafs and try all 3! this gets even
  better after it sits for a couple of days, the spice and orange flavors come
  out more.
