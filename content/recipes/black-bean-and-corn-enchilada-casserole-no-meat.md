title: Black Bean And Corn Enchilada Casserole No Meat

description: >-
  We do a meatless meal for dinner once a week.  i love mexican food, so i
  created this recipe.   this is really easy to change up by using flour
  tortillas, different kinds of rotel, using more or different cheeses, or green
  enchilada sauce (verde).  i measure the cheese since we are trying to be a bit
  healthier, but feel free to add more if you like.  i normally use a 7 x 11
  glass baking dish, so the measurements are for a full pan at that size. if you
  have leftover filling, you can eat it like a dip with tortilla chips. 
  sometimes i double the filling and freeze half of it for later.  when i know i
  have a busy day, i will thaw the filling and just assemble the bake quickly
  for an easy meal. if you must have meat, i think chicken would be a tasty
  add.  hope you like this recipe!
