 - Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet
 - Sautee the white portions of the scallions until tender , reserve the green portions
 - Add pasta and stir frequently until some of the grains are toasted golden brown
 - Add 1 cup of the chicken broth , and allow it to absorb , stirring frequently
 - When it's almost dry , add another 1 / 2 cup of broth
 - Continue in this fashion until the pasta is al dente
 - If you need more liquid , just add a bit more water
 - Add chicken , herbs , rest of scallion , greek seasoning , and juice from half the lemon , stirring until the chicken is warmed through and the herbs have wilted a bit
 - The orzo should be soft , and a thick , almost creamy sauce should have developed
 - At this point , add the myzithra cheese and stir until it's thoroughly incorporated
 - Add additional salt , pepper , and lemon juice to correct the seasoning
