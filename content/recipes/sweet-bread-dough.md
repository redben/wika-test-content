 - Put butter and milk in a small saucepan and heat until you first see bubbles , stirring occasionally to keep milk from burning
 - Then remove from heat and add the cold water
 - [we're scalding the milk and then cooling it back down to not kill the yeast]
 - Meanwhile , in a large mixing bowl , combine the yeast and warm water , then let sit for about 10 minutes
 - Once the yeast is activated and the milk mixture is under 130 degrees f , add the milk mixture to the yeast and also the sugar , egg , salt , and 2 cups of the flour
 - Beat with electric mixer on low speed until moistened and then mix on medium speed for two minutes
 - Then switch to a mixing spoon and add another 2 cups of flour
 - Finally , turn dough out on floured board and knead in additional flour to make a moderately stiff , soft dough
 - If you have a stand mixer , do all this mixing the easy way and use your dough hook
 - Place dough in a lightly greased bowl , turn once to grease surface , cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size--about one hour
 - The next step is to shape according to your desired final product , then cover and let rise again for about 45 minutes , then bake
 - For basic dinner rolls , divide dough into 16 pieces , roll each between your hands to make a ball
 - These will need to bake at 350 degrees f for about 15-18 minutes
 - For the more sugary products , use your favorite methods and fillings and increase your baking time as needed , temperature should be fine for most
