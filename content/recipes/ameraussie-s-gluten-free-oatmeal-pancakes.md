description: "I found an oatmeal pancake recipe that sounded really good but it wasn't gluten free. i changed and adapted it to suit my tastes, made it gluten free, and, voila! this is my favorite pancake recipe. it is hearty, heart-healthy, high protein, low glycemic and packs fiber for a satisfying breakfast that will carry you a long way.\r\n\r\nnote: the oats, milk and yogurt need to soak together for 8 hours before mixing in remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\nfreeze individual pancakes and you can reheat them in the oven (or microwave). using a moderate oven, i wrap 2 pancakes in foil and heat for about 15 minutes, no thawing necessary.\r\n\r\nthese make a great sandwich with your favorite nut butter. they are also great with your favorite jam, compote, syrup or combination topped with whipped cream!"

 - Prepare ahead , combine in one bowl the oats , yogurt and milk
 - Cover and let soak overnight , in the fridge
 - When you are ready to cook: whisk into the oat mixture the eggs , flour , agave nectar , vanilla , cinnamon , ginger , baking powder and salt
 - Mix well
 - If the mix is too runny , add more flour 1 / 4 cup at a time
 - If the mix is too dry , add more milk , about 1 / 4 cup
 - Heat griddle or skillet and lightly coat with canola oil
 - Low to medium heat
 - Using a ladle or cup , spoon about 1 / 4 cup of batter onto griddle in a 4 - 5 inch circle
 - Let cook until bubbles appear and outer edges start to look dry
 - Flip the pancake with a turner and cook the other side for about 1 - 2 minutes
 - If it's nearly done , the top of the pancake will spring back when you gently press a spot
 - Serve plain , buttered or with your favorite toppings
 - Prep and cooking time do not reflect soaking the oats
 - Cooking time is per pancake
 - Cooking one at a time obviously takes a lot more time than cooking mul
