description: >-
  When i have fingerling potatoes, or tiny red potatoes, i like to make this as
  a lunch side dish.  typically, i make this in the morning, let cool while i
  get ready for work, and pack just before stepping out the door.  the key to
  making this fast is cutting the potatoes very small- no larger than bite sized
  pieces.
