  Oh, my goodness!  rich, creamy...what more do you need?  i believe this is
  like my mom's recipe.  i found it on a blog, mommy's kitchen.  after searching
  here and not finding any recipe like it, i am posting it for everybody.  you
  may make your own crust or use a frozen one.  baking the crust is not included
  in the prep or cooking time.  if you like a darker chocolate, add more cocoa.
