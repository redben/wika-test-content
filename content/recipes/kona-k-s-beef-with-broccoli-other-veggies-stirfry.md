  Very easy & versatile recipe that i came up with one night when i was craving
  chinese style beef with broccoli. i just threw in whatever veggies i could
  find in the fridge, so feel free to modify the recipe with the vegetables you
  have on hand. also, the mr. & i are garlic lovers, so please feel free to
  adjust the garlic according to your own personal tastes. you can adjust the
  amount of red pepper flakes depending on how much spice you like.
