  When i was a kid i never went to a card party or gathering of any kind without
  seeing dressed bananas on the table.  my dad alone would go through at least a
  banana and a half!!  people would ask my mother to make these and bring them
  as a dish for potluck parties, so i was in charge of smearing on the mayo.  
  they sound odd when you read the ingredients, but just give them a try.  i
  loved them then, and i have to admit, i make them every now and again now!  of
  course now i choose a healthier mayo :)

 - Chop the peanuts into small pieces
 - They should be like the chopped peanuts you sprinkle on a sundae
 - Peel the banana , and cut into 3 pieces
 - Smaller bananas will make 2 sections
 - Rub the outside of the banana with a thin coat of mayo
 - Just enough for the peanuts to stick
 - Too much will just make them a goopy mess
 - You can use a brush for this , but i always just used my nice clean hands
 - It's just enough to make the banana shiny with the mayo coating
 - You may not use the entire 1 tbsp of mayo , so don't worry if you have some leftover
 - Roll the banana in the chopped peanuts to completely cover
 - There should be an even coating of peanuts on the banana pieces , in a single layer
 - Put them on the serving plate , and wrap the plate with plastic wrap
 - Put them in the fridge until ready to eat
 - These are best if eaten the same day so the nuts stay crunchy !
