  These noodles are a spin off of the classic soba noodle, but quicker to make.
  i usually have all of the things this recipe requires in my cupboard all the
  time, so i can whip it up in ten minutes. quite tasty on a hot summer day!

 - Boil the spaghetti according to package directions , drain , and coat with a small amount of oil to keep from sticking
 - Set aside
 - Mix the sesame oil , soy sauce , sugars , ginger , garlic powder , chili sauce & black pepper together in a bowl , whisk very well , or toss everything in a tupperware and shake it really good
 - I like my veggies crisp and fresh , but if you want them cooked , steam them for 5 minutes
 - Toss the pasta with the sauce and vegetables , refrigerate until cold , and enjoy !
