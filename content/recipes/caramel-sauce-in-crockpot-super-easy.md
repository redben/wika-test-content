description: "My very good friend jana mck. gave me this recipe for the stove top.  i have adapted it for the crock pot. it makes for a super easy, no fuss caramel dipping sauce.  great for fruit, nuts and even pretzels.  only 2 ingredients.\r\nremember crock pots vary in their heat intensities.  mine gets very hot on high. finally, you might want to line the crockpot with those disposable liners to make it easier to clean up the sticky glue from the can and make sure you wait until the can is warm, not hot or the \"sauce\" will explode."
