 - Start with shallots
 - Boil them few minutes , then in a sieve drain under cold running water and peel off the skin
 - Now it comes off much easier than if you tried to do it before boiling
 - In a skillet brown tofu with one tbsp peanut oil
 - Stir often to make sure that all sides are nicely brown
 - Set aside
 - Now saute the onion on the rest of the oil until slightly soft
 - Add celery and carrot and sweat for a few minute add tofu , mushrooms , vegetable stock , red wine and mix in some tomato paste
 - Grate garlic and add to the stew
 - Reduce the heat to medium , cover and continue cooking for 15 minute
 - After 15 min add shallots and continue cooking for another 15 minute
 - At the end whisk in some cornstarch mixed with cold water and leave simmering for 2-3 min more
 - Serve with mashed potatoes
