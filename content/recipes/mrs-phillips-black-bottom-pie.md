 - Combine the first 3 ingredients until the dough forms coarse crumbs
 - Press the mixture into a large pie pan - 10 inches works best
 - Bake at 375 degrees f for 12-15 minutes , or until golden brown
 - Allow to cool completely
 - Combine the gelatin and rum in a heatproof cup
 - Place the cup in a pan of simmering water

 - Pour the chocolate chips into a large heatproof bowl
 - Set aside
 - Add 1 / 2 cup sugar , the salt and cornstarch into a large saucepan
 - Gradually add the milk while cooking over low heat - stirring constantly

 - Stir thoroughly
 - Return pan to heat and cook through for 2 minutes
 - Remove from heat again
 - Scoop out 1 1 / 2 cups of the heated and thickened custard and add to the chocolate chips
 - Stir until the chips are completely melted
 - Mix in the vanilla extract
 - Pour the chocolate mixture into the cooled pie shell
 - Chill thoroughly
 - While the chocolate layer of the pie is cooling , beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until frothy
 - Gradually add the remaining 1 / 2 cup sugar
 - Beat until stiff peaks form
 - Set aside
 - Remove the gelatin-rum mixture from simmering water
 - Add to the saucepan containing the remaining custard
 - Stir thoroughly
 - Fold this mixture carefully into the egg whites
