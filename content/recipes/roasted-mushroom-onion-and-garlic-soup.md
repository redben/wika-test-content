description: >-
  A tasty mushroom soup made with no milk or cream.  white beans are used to
  thicken, and roasting mushrooms, onions, and garlic in the oven add great
  flavor.  it's a flexible recipe.  you can use any combination of mushrooms
  that you'd like, and any kind of broth that you'd like.  this recipe calls for
  pureeing the onions, garlic and a small amount of the mushrooms, leaving most
  of the mushroom quarters for the soup, but you can puree as many of the
  mushrooms as you'd like. i've tried it as written, and also with all of it
  pureed. i actually like it best all pureed - it's like a more traditional
  mushroom soup.  adapted from a recipe found online - the original also called
  for 3 cans of beans, half of which were pureed, and half were left whole for
  the soup.
