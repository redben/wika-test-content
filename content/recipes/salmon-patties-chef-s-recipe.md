  Darren is a close friend of ours and has been a chef for over 27 years.  he
  worked in an english pub called "the pig and whistle"; this is their recipe
  for salmon patties.  serve hot with chips and either tomato sauce or tartar
  sauce; both are suitable but not together!  i make this when i have leftover
  mashed potatoes or i make extra for this meal the next day. cheap and the
  patties can be made the night before. recipe can be doubled and tripled.
  recipe does not include resting time.

 - Place mashed potatoes , salmon , egg , green onion , lemon pepper , worcestershire sauce , and breadcrumbs thoroughly in a large bowl
 - Use your hands
 - I like using food preparation gloves
 - Use wet hands to form into patties
 - Roll patties in the extra breadcrumbs
 - Put patties on a plate and leave for at least for an hour , or up to overnight
 - They break apart if not left to rest
 - Cover with cling wrap until ready to use
 - When ready to cook , heat the oil in a large fry pan / skillet
 - I use my electric skillet up to number 8 , medium high
 - Add the patties when the oil is hot
 - Test a piece of bread , it should turn golden within 5 to 10 seconds
 - Fry one side until golden and flip
 - Fry the other side until golden
 - Serve with chips and salad / veggies
