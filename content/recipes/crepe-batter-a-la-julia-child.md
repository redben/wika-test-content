title: Crepe Batter A La Julia Child

  Clipped from today's orlando sentinel.  these crepes can be filled with an
  endless list of possibilities, from savory to sweet.  chilling the batter
  allows the flour to expand in the liquid and ensures a light, tender crepe. 
  so for the best results, make the batter at least 2 hours in advance -- it
  will even keep in the refrigerator for a day or two.  i am going to add a few
  teaspoons of sugar and some vanilla to the batter and fill with nutella and
  sliced bananas for a decadent weekend brunch.
