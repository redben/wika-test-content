  I wrote out this recipe ages ago -- don't remember where i found it -- but
  finally tried it this week.  oh. my. goodness.  i have been missing out!!! 
  simple and irrisistible!  tastes good the first day, but definitely better a
  day later; my recommendation would be to make it a day in advance if it's for
  a special occasion.
