 - If roasting pecans , place on a greased cookie sheet in preheated 350 degree oven
 - Spread them out in a thin layer to roast evenly
 - Roast for 5 minutes , stir , then roast for another 5 minutes until you can smell them
 - Take care not to scorch them !
 - As soon as they come out of the oven , place them on a flat plate or piece of parchment paper to cool
 - Add cooled pecans to food processor and blend on high until finely ground , 2-3 minutes
 - Add vegetable oil 1 / 2 tbs at a time and continue to blend until butter reaches desired consistency
 - Add salt to taste
 - Place in an airtight container and store in the fridge
 - Usually , this will keep 1 to 2 months if you used fresh nuts
 - Storing at room temperature will accelerate rancidification
