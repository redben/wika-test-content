  I got this out of the cooks country feb/march 2009 magazine. hubby and i loved
  it, both of us prefer the boneless style "wings". for the hot sauce, cooks
  country recommends franks (which we used) over tabasco. we served it with the
  standard blue cheese dressing (i made the cooks country version) and celery.
  prep time is a total guess since i have not made this since last year. i can
  update it when i make it again (this weekend!).
