description: "This world war ii recipe was first published by marmite and is a tasty vegetarian alternative to regular rissoles. i've rewritten the directions to be a little more precise and suit modern methods to a greater extent. marmite is a british 'spread' and you can obtain it at an international grocery store in the united states. as a wwii ad for marmite says \"stock your larder with a few jars of marmite now!\". enjoy :) \r\n\r\nplease note: preparation time includes rice cooking time!"
