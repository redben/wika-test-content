 - The most important part of cooking with an iron skillet is to heat the pan first without any fat inside
 - When it is really hot , add your chicken fat ) shmaltz
 - Turn down the heat to simmer
 - I play with the gas burner while cooking , up and down according to the heat in the pan
 - If you notice the oil burning , turn down the heat
 - I immediately add the chopped onions after i added the oil
 - Keep stirring with a wooden spoon
 - The onions will turn translucent
 - If there is not enough shmaltz oil in the pan add a little vegtable oil and continue cooking the onions
 - Try not to overcook the onions
 - Take them out before they turn brown
 - While this is going on , rinse the livers under cold water and drain
 - After the onions are removed from the pan clean the pan with a slotted spoon of any dark pieces of onion
 - Then add a little more shmalltz to the pan and some livers
 - Do not crowd the pan
 - Cook livers one pan at a time
 - I constantly keep turning the livers
 - I cut into the liver to see if it is done
 - It should be cooked all the way thru just not burned
 - Next , combine the livers and the onions in a bowl
 - In the cuisinart fitted with the blade on the bottom place a small amount of the ingredients and pulse until you like the consistancy
 - I like it soft like a pate
 - Do this until all of the liver and onions are finely mashed
 - I then combine the pate with the hand chopped onions
 - Add salt and pepper to taste
 - I like the pate to be slightly more peppery
 - It looks nice to garnish with the extra chopped raw onions and if you like , some chopped hard boiled eggs
 - During passover , you can eat this with matzah or serve with crackers
 - Place in refrigerator immediately after preparation for at least a few hours in a sealed container
 - I enjoy the liver after it is removed from the frig for 20 minute happy cooking !
