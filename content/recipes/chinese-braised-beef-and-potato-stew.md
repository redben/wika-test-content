 - Then add soy sauce and bring to a boil
 - Add soy sauce mixture to the saucepan with the beef , cover the dish , and braise for an hour or more , stirring occasionally , and discarding water that has condensed under the lid
 - While the meat and vegetables cook , peel and cut up the carrots and potatoes
 - Twenty to forty minutes before serving , add the carrots and potatoes and salt and pepper
 - When the potatoes are cooked through and the sauce is just starting to thicken naturally from the potato starch , the dish is prepared
 - In north china , this stew is served with thick , chewy , crusty flat bread

 - Garlic-stir-fried spinach or other greens makes an excellent accompaniment
