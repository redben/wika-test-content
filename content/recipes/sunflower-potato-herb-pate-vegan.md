date: 2010-11-07T00:00:00.000Z
description: >-
  A delicious veg*n pate made in b.c. comes from hornby island pate co.  this is
  my version, inspired by their herb variety.  it's super easy to make, very
  similar to this version from the book extraveganza:  recipe #287199.  you more
  or less throw everything into the food processor, blend until smooth and then
  bake.  delicious in sandwiches or served with crackers. you can bake this in a
  loaf tin, or something slightly larger such as an 8x8 square which would make
  it easy to cut into squares and freeze.
