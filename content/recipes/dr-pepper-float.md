description: >-
  Dr. pepper is my favorite soft drink, so it's no surprise that this is my
  favorite float.  if you want to, you could use another soda, but dp is my
  personal preference.  i would recommend ginger ale, cola, or root beer (well,
  i really don't care for root beer, but many people do.)
