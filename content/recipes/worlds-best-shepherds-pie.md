  Shepherds pie is my favorite dish. i make it multiple ways. this way is the
  easiest and most tasty. don't be afraid to add or subtract ingredients to suit
  your taste buds. the key ingredient for this is the cream of corn. unless you
  absolutely hate cream of corn i wouldn't recommend omitting it. but that's up
  to you. enjoy!!
