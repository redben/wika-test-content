  I don't know if this is exactly how gramma made her potato pancakes, as i
  never got the actual recipe.  but i remember grating onion for hers so this is
  a hybrid of my memory and a basic version from scandinavia.com.  i think a
  major component missing in the online recipe was baking powder.  also, this
  can be started the night before by grating the potatoes and then covering them
  with cold water and refrigerating overnight.
