  This recipe is from tyler florence, a side to his prime rib recipe. i've made
  it a few times and substituted 1 package frozen pearl onions, thawed, for the
  red onions, and added medium sized button mushrooms half way through the
  cooking time.  i was never sure just how much a 'half bunch' of fresh thyme
  was, (and rarely have it on hand) so i used a little less than a tblsp of
  dried thyme. i also doubled the sauce recipe, due to the size of the onion
  pkg, and addition of the mushrooms.  delicious.
