 - In a large skillet , heat cooking oil over medium heat
 - Toss in minced garlic , and cook 2-3 minutes , or until lightly browned
 - Add chopped ginger , cook for another 2-3 minutes
 - Add beef , and stir often , cooking until meat is just browned , about 5 minutes
 - Meanwhile , mix both packages of gravy with 3 cup water and bring to a boil in a saucepan over medium high heat
 - Add balsamic vinegar and worchesire sauce
 - Once meat is browned , transfer entire pan to slow cooker , including juices
 - Top with gravy mixture , coating evenly
 - Cook for 7-8 hours on low setting
 - I served this over mashed potatoes because it's all we had in the house , but it would work well with egg noodles aswell
