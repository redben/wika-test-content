  The curry powder adds a unique touch to this hearty soup, don't skip the
  cheese topping it's the perfect finishing touch! this was a dish all our kids
  would eat when little and the was the one way everyone ate cooked cabbage. a
  bonus was how easy it was to make. the veggies are flexible, my kids didn't
  like zuchinni so i would sub frozen french cut green beans or corn.
