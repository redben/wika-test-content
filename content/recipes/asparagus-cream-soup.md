  "the most cherished of all the vegetables in germany is asparagus. although
  the green variety is enjoyed in many dishes, the most prized is white
  asparagus.  either variety works well in this asparagus cream soup" from
  classic international recipes.  the serving amount is for 6 side dish or
  appetizer servings, not for a meal.  i'd say it is 2 or 3 servings if used as
  a main dish soup.
