description: "Another recipe i have \"de-glutened\" for my son...a yummy way for us to celebrate autumn.  i found that this particular bread batter bakes better in the small (disposable) foil loaf pans rather than regular sized loaf pans.  the perfect gift for neighbors, teachers, friends.\r\ni live in the mile high city, so those not at altitude might need to tweak the leavening (baking soda, baking powder, salt) a bit."
