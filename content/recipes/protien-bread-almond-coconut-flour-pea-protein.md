description: >-
  This is a low carb, high protein bread created mainly with coconut flour,
  almond flour, pea protein, and liquid egg whites. make sure to use the
  drinkable coconut milk found in a carton. i created this recipe from an
  amalgam of several paleo recipes i found online, then added my own touch.
  there are only 2 net carbs per slice and 13g protein. i hope you like it!
