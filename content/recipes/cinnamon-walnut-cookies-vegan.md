  Well, here it's the third week in july and it's raining and we're experiencing
  unseasonably cool temps. what's a cookgirl to do stuck inside the house all
  day? a: bake cookies! this recipe is from the delicious living magazine and
  elaborated by me to give the cookies a middle eastern flavor. gluten-free, egg
  and dairy free-easy! the barberries, cardamom and orange blossom water were
  all my addition.
