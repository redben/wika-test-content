  A family favorite, i took bits and pieces from several recipes and tweaked it
  to our preferences.  the first time i made this, i used the juice of 2 lemons,
  which was not enough, and probably 1 cup of brown sugar or a bit more, which
  was about right.  in addition to the lemon juice, i added a bit of cider
  vinegar as well - the soup needed more of a sour taste.  turned out great!
