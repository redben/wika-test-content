description: >-
  This bread is bee-yew-tiful toasted and even better as cinnamon toast, but you
  won’t believe how amazingly delicious it is for grilled cheese sandwiches!  
  it's soft and tender, moist and flexible enough to fold without cracking or
  tearing. it is the texture of your husband’s and children’s white bread
  dreams. that’s how i finally got mine to eat true whole wheat bread (but i
  still have to leave out the nuts, grains, and seeds from theirs). it’s the
  lecithin. i have never been able to achieve this texture without it. so, while
  it is not necessary to the successful taste or rising of the bread, it is
  definitely necessary for this specific texture and softness.
