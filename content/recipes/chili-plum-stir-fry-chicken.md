  This is a combination of two recipes from taste.com.au that the dh and i
  combined to come up with something we both really like.  the night we made it
  we had several dishes on the go and i was prepping for them as well so times
  are estimated to if you were only cooking this dish update - o'kay making this
  once again i have added other vegies tonight which were some julienned carrot,
  broccoli and cauliflower flowerettes and snow peas and served on top of some
  hokien noodles - just a variation.  another update - we tried this tonight
  have now tried with beef, rump strips (possibly could be better to beat out
  and cut into  strips though we think. depending on the quality of your rump)
  and added 3/4 teaspoons chinese five spice to step 2 but would suggest 1/2
  teaspoon) but still thoroughly enjoyed and we are smacking our lips still 2
  hours later.
