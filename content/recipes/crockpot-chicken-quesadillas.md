  Nothing is better than coming home and having your dinner practically waiting
  for you! this chicken could also be used on nachos, in tacos, or in some sort
  of mexican casserole. it is moist and delicious and literally falls apart in
  the crock pot. i found this recipe posted by a molly day on another cooking
  site. enjoy!
