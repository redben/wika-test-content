 - Biga:
 - Make the biga by stirring together the yeast , flour , and water
 - The dough will be very stiff and dry
 - Place it in a lightly greased bowl , cover it , and let it rest at room temperature overnight
 - Dough:
 - Next day , combine the biga with the remaining ingredients in a large mixing bowl , or in the bowl of an electric mixer , mixing to form a shaggy , sticky dough
 - Knead the dough until smooth , then place it in a lightly greased bowl and let it rest for 1 hour
 - It will become quite puffy , though it may not double in bulk
 - Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface , gently deflate it , and knead in the nuts and fruit
 - Shape the dough into a slightly flattened ball and place it on a greased sheet pan , or into a greased 9" round cake pan
 - Cover the pan with a proof cover or some lightly greased plastic wrap
 - Let the loaf rise for about 90 minutes or until puffy
 - Preferred 2nd rise method: for the second rise , let rise for 1 hour then put into the refrigerator and bake the next day or so
 - The bread gets better texture and taste from a slow cool rise
 - Preheat the oven to 350f bake the bread for about 50 to 55 minutes , until its interior registers 190f to 195f on an instant-read thermometer
 - Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on rack
