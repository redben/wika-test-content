description: >-
  It was in 1904 that ovaltine was developed in bern, switzerland.  and it has
  remained a staple milk-flavoring favorite since it was first introduced to the
  world market more than a hundred years ago.  here, it gets an update and is
  paired with a natural accompaniment for a creamy chocolate drink,
  peppermint!   the great thing about this drink is that it can be served either
  cold or hot.
