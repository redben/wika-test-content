 - Start with a fresh egg
 - If the egg isn't fresh , the egg white deteriorates which leads to that jellyfish-like tendrils of whites seen with some poached eggs
 - To test for freshness , drop the egg into water
 - If it sinks , its fresh and perfect for poaching and souffles
 - If it stays submerged but lays with its wide-end up , its older but still good for most recipes
 - If it floats , throw it out
 - Pour 1 / 2 cup vinegar into each of 2 small bowls
 - Crack 1 egg into each bowl , taking care not to break the yolk
 - Let stand for 5 minutes
 - Meanwhile , bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat
 - Using a whisk , vigorously swirl the water until a vortex forms in the center
 - Slip 1 egg with the vinegar into the vortex and continue to swirl the water with the whisk around the edges of the pan until it returns to a boil
 - The egg white should wrap tightly around the yolk , forming an oval shape
 - As soon as the water returns to a boil , reduce the heat to medium and gently simmer the egg , frequently swirling the water , for 2 minutes
 - Using a slotted spoon , lift the egg from water and use kitchen shears to trim any stray pieces of egg white
 - Place the egg on paper towels and gently blot
 - Transfer the egg to a bowl or plate
 - Repeat with remaining egg
 - Season with salt and pepper
