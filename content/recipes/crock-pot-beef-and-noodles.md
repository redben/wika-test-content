 - Start with putting roast and broth or stock in crock pot and cook on high for 4-6 hours
 - Adding salt , pepper and garlic powder to taste
 - Once the beef has cooked add the noodles and let cook for another 30 min to 1 hour
 - You can also add any veggies that you would like to this recipe and can shred the beef or cut into larger pieces for serving
 - I like to serve this over mashed potatoes
