description: >-
  This sauce is meant to be served with kebabs, so would go great with any
  grilled meat.  this recipe calls for greek yogurt which is similar to plain
  yogurt, but thicker.  you can thicken ordinary plain yogurt by lining a
  strainer with cheesecloth, placing yogurt inside and letting it drip for about
  20 minutes or to desired thickness.
