 - Scald the milk and dissolve in it the sugar , salt and butter
 - Cool to lukewarm
 - In a large bowl , dissolve the yeast in the warm water
 - Add the cooled milk , flour , onion and herbs
 - Stir well with a large wooden spoon
 - When the batter is smooth , cover the bowl with a towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until triple in bulk- about 45 minutes
 - Stir down , and beat vigorously for a few minutes , then turn into a greased bread pan
 - Let it stand for 10 minutes before putting into a preheated 350 deg
 - Oven
 - Bake about one hour
 - The dough will be sticky- resist the urge to add too much flour
 - My bread was done in 50 minutes
 - Of course you can vary the herbs
 - Delicious !
