  This is a simple vegetarian recipe from cooking light. i am including
  directions for making your own tortilla chips but you could certainly use
  store-bought. i love the homemade tortilla chips, though! you can make or use
  more tortilla chips if you would like more than 8 tortilla chips per serving -
  there is plently of bean mixture if you want to do that. these nachos are
  different because you aren't melting the cheese over the chips. this recipe
  utilizes crumbled queso fresco instead. i really love the flavor of the beans
  with the cumin, chili powder and garlic. you may substitute black beans for
  the pinto beans, if you prefer. enjoy!
