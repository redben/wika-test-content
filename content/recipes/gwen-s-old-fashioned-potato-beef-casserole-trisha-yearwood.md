  This recipe is from trisha yearwood's cookbook and she has made it on her
  show. it is her mom's recipe. the casserole has mild flavor since it is from
  long ago so if you require a lot of seasoning kick it up a notch in your own
  way. it is a rich casserole with potatoes and ground beef. perfect to whip up
  for a meat and potatoes guy, a cold night's dinner or anytime you want a
  throwback to an easier time. kids and adults enjoy it. the hardest part is
  peeling all the potatoes but other than that it is easy. serve with a
  vegetable or salad. enjoy! chefdlh
