  As some of you may know i love pasta! i have tried a ton of different marinara
  sauces prepared in many different recipes. i have found a few that are pretty
  good, many of which are on this site, but i created this recipe to meet all of
  the requirements i look for in a perfect sauce. a little sweet, a little
  spicy, not too watery, not too chunky, and not too difficult. i have served
  this recipe many times and it always gets a five star review. the secret
  ingredient here is the anchovy, you can't tell it is in there but it adds
  amazing depth of flavor to this sauce. i really hope that you all enjoy this!
