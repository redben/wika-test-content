  I love lentils and am trying to eat more of them. these would probably speed
  by in a pressure cooker but i've only done them the stovetop way so far.
  inspired by both indian and indonesian cooking. you can use a 15-oz can of
  brown lentils to reduce the cooking time if you like, i sized it the same with
  2/3 dry cup and included instructions for canned as well. the aseptic or
  half-gallon boxes of so delicious coconut milk would probably work well too if
  you just measure out 14 oz. i use 365 light coconut but "light coconut milk"
  isn't recognized in the ingredient database. "brown lentils" also aren't
  recognized? 1/3 cup each of brown and green lentils would also be cool!

 - Wash and sort through the lentils to remove pebbles , bad ones , etc
 - Bring the coconut milk to a low boil and add the lentils and spices but not the shredded coconut
 - Loosely cover and let simmer for 20-25 minutes or until the lentils have softened
 - Fluff up the lentils and mix in the coconut so it adds a nice crunch
 - Serve with veggies and rice and enjoy
