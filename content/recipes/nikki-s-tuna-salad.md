  This tuna salad came together when i was looking for a recipe that wasn't the
  same old boring tuna salad.  it combines two recipes with my own twist and is
  large for family functions!  you can use more mayonnaise depending on how wet
  you like your salad and i use a sugar substitute because i'm diabetic.
