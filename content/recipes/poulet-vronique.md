  Adapted by me from my copy of '365 ways to cook chicken' cookbook and several
  online recipes. i used both green and red grapes for added color. serve with
  simple sides such as saffron rice or roasted new potatoes; lightly steamed
  seasonal vegetables or an uncomplicated mesclun salad. elegant yet easy main
  dish!
