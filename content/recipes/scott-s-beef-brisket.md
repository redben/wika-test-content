description: "I got this from quick cooking magazine in 2006 and it is fantastic!  this is the only way i'll fix brisket.  my kids love it!  dh says it's the best he's ever had!  made this with my recipe stir fry cabbage plus more (#451085) for st. patrick's day 2011.\r\n\r\nthis is a fresh brisket, not a corned beef brisket.  prep time does not include overnight marinade.  you can lighten this up by using diet coke, margarine or olive oil and low or no sugar bbq sauce.  ya'll let me know what you think!"
