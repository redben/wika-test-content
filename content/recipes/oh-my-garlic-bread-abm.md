  If you want to pinpoint any suspected vampires be sure to have this bread
  circulating at the next get together, it will do the trick better than van
  helsing. on the other hand if your a true garlic lover this one is for you. it
  makes a wicked grilled ham and cheese sandwich! the 10 min is just for the
  measuring and getting it into the machine, after that it's up to you and your
  bread maker and how you want to finish it. a beautiful braided loaf will take
  longer to make than letting it bake in the machine of instance.
