description: "If i hadn’t eaten the turkish eggs at peter gordon’s restaurant, the providores, i most certainly wouldn’t be tempted by the idea of poached eggs on greek yogurt. i say that only to pre-empt any hesitancy on your part. for çilbir, pronounced “chulburr,” is a revelation and a complete sensation.\_"

 - Fill a wide-ish saucepan with water to come about 4cm up the sides of the pan
 - Put it on the heat and cover so that it heats up faster
 - Line a large plate with some kitchen roll , get out a slotted spoon , and put both near the pan now
 - Now in another pan on which a heatproof bowl can sit comfortably again with water to come 34cm up the sides , and bring to the boil
 - Put the yogurt in said bowl , stir in the garlic and salt , and ? sit it on top of this pan , making sure the base of the bowl doesnt touch the water
 - Stir it until it gets to body temperature and has the consistency of lightly whipped double cream
 - Turn off the heat and leave the bowl as it is , over the pan
 - Melt the butter gently in a small pan until it is just beginning to turn a hazelnutty brown , but make sure its not actually burning
 - Turn the heat off under the pan , then stir in the olive oil , followed by the beautiful red pepper flakes
 - It will foam up fierily
 - Leave to one side while you get on with the eggs
 - And this is when you should be thinking of putting the toast on
 - When you are ready to poach the eggs , crack the first egg into a ne-mesh strainer suspended over a small bowl , then lift it up a little and swirl gently for about 30 seconds , letting the watery part of the white drip into the bowl
 - Gently
 - Proceed as above with the second egg
 - When the poaching water is just starting to simmer , take a cup or ramekin in each hand and gently slide in the eggs , one on each side of the pan
 - Turn the heat right down so there is no movement in the water whatsoever , and poach the eggs for 34 minutes until the whites are set and the yolks still runny
 - Transfer the eggs with your slotted spoon to the paper-lined plate to remove any excess water
 - Do remember to switch off the heat
 - Sorry to state the obvious , but i have too often left it on this low without noticing
 - Divide the warm creamy yogurt between two shallow bowls , top each with a poached egg , pour the peppery butter around and slightly over the yogurt , scatter the chopped dill on top , and eat dreamily , dipping in some thick well-toasted bread as you do so
