 - Cut cabbage into quarters and soak in tap water with a pinch of sugar
 - And let set for 10 minute then drain in a colinder and set aside
 - In a deep skillet brown diced onions , when lightly browned add the cabbage to the onions using a wooden spoon to seperate the leaves of the cabbage
 - Reduce fire to a simmer gentle folding the cabbage into the onions , allowing the cabbage to turn a golden brown
 - When golden brown add the water and bullion cube , salt , pepper , and a pinch of sugar fold in till well dispersed cover with tight lid , reduce the fire to low and allow to simmer for 15 minutes
 - My family like to have cornbread with this dish
 - If you like your cornbread a little spicy add some chopped jelapeno sparingly to the cornbread batter
 - Just the right touch to this easy to prepare meal
