description: >-
  A little experimentation led to this family favorite. this is a less expensive
  alternative to ready-made pancake syrup that tastes similar and has no corn
  syrup. easy to make, too! (when it's completely cooled, i pour it into the
  empty container from eggo syrup, which has a no-drip spout.)
