description: >-
  Recimeals are designed to be complete meals that need only be accompanied by a
  beverage, and sometimes a side salad or slice of bread. a recimeal provides
  significant amounts of at least three of the five mypyramid food groups: about
  1/2 cup of fruits, 1/2 cup of vegetables, 1 ounce equivalent of grain foods, 2
  ounces or the equivalent of lean meat or beans or 1 cup or the equivalent of
  milk per recipe serving. as a convenient one-dish meal, this elegant dish can
  be an easy pantry meal on its own, or deliciously accompanied by a garden
  salad with crusty bread. made with protein-rich canned chicken, itâ€™s just as
  delicious with canned turkey or crabmeat.
