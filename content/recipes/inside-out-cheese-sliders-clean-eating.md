 - Place oven rack 6 to 7 inches from broiler and preheat to high
 - Cover a baking sheet or broiler pan with foil
 - In a large bowl , combine beef , salt and pepper
 - Divide meat into 8 equal balls , about 2 inches in diameter
 - Divide cheese into 8 equal portions
 - With your thumb , make an indentation in 1 of the meatballs and insert a portion of cheese cubes
 - Push the edges of the meatball over the indentation to completely cover the cheese , then flatten the meatball into a 1 / 2-3 / 4-inch-thick patty
 - Place on prepared baking sheet
 - Repeat with remaining meatballs and portions of cheese
 - Broil until tops of patties are deeply browned , 6 to 7 minutes
 - Flip and broil until the second side is browned and patties are firm to the touch with no pink remaining in the center , about 5 more minutes
 - In a small bowl , stir together mustard and honey
 - To serve , split open each roll and spread on 1 tsp mustard mixture
 - Top with 1 patty and spinach leaves , dividing equally among all sliders
 - Option: if you prefer to cook the sliders in a skillet rather than the broiler , mist the skillet with olive oil cooking spray and cook the burgers in 2 batches over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes per side
 - By cooking in batches you eliminate overcrowding the pan , which would cause the patties to steam instead of developing a flavorful golden exterior
