description: >-
  This simple pasta dish is very cheap to make, just a few ingredients and a
  good olive oil turn this into a meal to relish. i cook the bones from a
  chicken carcass to make a stock, chicken stock cubes work well if you don't
  want to make your own stock. pasta shells are prefered in this dish as they
  catch the chick peas and the final result is like having a shell with an
  oyster inside. kids seem to go for this version of pasta that i cooked many
  times while in italy. serve topped with parmesan cheese and drizzled with
  olive oil.
