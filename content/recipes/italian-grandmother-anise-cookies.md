  This is my grandmother's recipe, but since i didn't have a chance to know her
  i think of them as my mom's cookies. she uses 5 pounds of flour in her batch
  because she makes them once a year for the family reunion, so i whittled her
  recipe down into a 4 dozen batch. the amount of anise is up to you. if you
  think you didn't add enough anise to the cookies, you can add some to the
  icing. i like to leave some of them unfrosted since they're pretty darn good
  plain.
