  I found this recipe in fannie flagg's fried green tomatoes at the whistlestop
  cafe cookbook.  i've made it many times and it is delicious.  the original
  recipe called for 1 tbsp. salt but the last time i made it that was too much
  so i changed it to 2 tsp..........you may want to adjust the amount lower and
  taste it before adding more.
