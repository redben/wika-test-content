  While reading through some soup recipes online one day, i came across this one
  and realized that i actually had all the ingredients on hand. since the
  weather outside was awful, i whipped up a batch, hoping to thaw out my
  roommate when she got home from class. she loved it and so has everyone else
  i've made it for. it never seemed to me that there was enough water to cook
  the potatoes, corn, and onion, but trust me, there is! great with bacon or
  ham, and some cheddar cheese if desired.
