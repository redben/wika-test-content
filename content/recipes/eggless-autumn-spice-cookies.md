description: >-
  A mildly spicy cookie made without eggs. i am allergic to eggs, so i love
  cookies that come out great without the eggs. if you wish to make them with
  eggs, reduce the maple syrup to 1/4 cup and add one egg. these go great with a
  cup of coffee or milk. while they are baking, the whole house smells like
  autumn. they are a lightly crunchy cookie.
