 - You can use 6 medium size chops or 8 smaller ones to make this
 - Mix the first five ingredients together and pour over pork chops
 - Cover and let simmer for about one hour
 - Uncover and turn up the heat until sauce is thick
 - Watch this closely because the sauce will go from very thin to thick quickly
 - Turn chops about every 15 minutes
 - I made the sauce and used boneless chicken breast
 - I baked this in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes and thicken the sauce with a little corn starch
