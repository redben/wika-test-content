  This is one of my mom's recipes and one that both dad and i really enjoyed. 
  always looked forward to the fall and apples from macintosh tree out back! 
  sometimes mom called it apple pudding other times she called it apple
  upside-down cake, either way it was a cake texture with baked apples and a
  carmel type sauce.  always a treat to come home from school and smell this in
  the oven!  serve it warm as is or with vanilla ice cream!
