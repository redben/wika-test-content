 - Before you begin : lay out bread slices and allow to get a crusty as possible this allows the bread to become very dry and crusty so it can absorb as much pudding as possible
 - Also combine the raisins and whiskey in a small bowl , cover , and place in the refrigerator overnight to allow the raisins to soak up as much whiskey as possible
 - If you forget , the raisins only need to sit for about 30 minutes to soak up quite a bit of whiskey
 - Jack daniel's caramel-whiskey sauce: combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat
 - Stir continuously until sugar dissolves
 - Simmer until sugar mixture is golden
 - Do not stir !
 - Remove from heat
 - Carefully add butter and cream cheese , stirring constantly with a whisk until all clumps are dissolved
 - Caution ! mixture will bubble vigorously and release a lot of hot steam
 - Cool slightly
 - Stir in whiskey and milk
 - Mixture will bubble a bit at this step as well
 - Pudding: preheat oven to 350f
 - Brush melted butter on one side of french bread slices
 - Bake buttered side up until lightly toasted , about 10 minutes
 - Cut bread into 1 / 2 inch cubes and set aside
 - Combine milk , sugar , vanilla extract , evaporated milk , eggs , and undrained whiskey mixture in a large bowl
 - Stir well with a whisk
 - Add bread cubes , pressing down gently to moisten
 - Let stand about 20 minutes
 - If your bowl is a little small , gently fold the cubes into the mixture with a spatula
 - Pour bread mixture into a 13 x 9-inch baking dish coated well with cooking spray
 - Combine sugar and cinnamon
 - Sprinkle over pudding
 - Bake at 350f for 35 minutes or until set
 - Serve warm with jack daniel's caramel-whiskey sauce
 - To make this kid friendly: substitute apple juice for jack daniel's in pudding and 1 tablespoon imitation rum extract and 3 tablespoons water in caramel-whiskey sauce
