description: "5-ingredient fix contest entry. you say you don't want to make a large, traditional st. patrick's day meal this year, but you still long for the great taste? here is a \"simply\" wonderful way to still experience the holiday without the hassle. it makes a terrific brunch item. it is so quick and easy, and the best part is that you can make it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. i've made this dish for all 3 meals (but not in the same day, of course).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*note: you could also throw in some beaten eggs and shredded cheese for a super simple breakfast omelet, frittata or quiche (see photos) that the whole family would love. and if you did happen to make a full-blown corned beef and cabbage dinner, use the leftovers (following steps #4, #5 and #7) for a simple and quick meal. endless possibilities with this recipe."
