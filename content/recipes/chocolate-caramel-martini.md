 - Swirl somebody's mother's caramel sauce around the inside rim of a martini glass
 - Fill shaker with ice
 - Pour in ingredients
 - Shake well and pour into the martini glass
 - If done correctly , it should taste like an adult milkshake
 - A little whipped cream on top never hurt anyone either !
