  Another recipe i am posting for india that is from "the bbq bible" by steven
  raichlen.  here is what he states:  "the procedure is simple enough. when you
  order naan, the baker takes a soft white ball of dough and rolls it into a
  flat bread. a few slaps from hand to hand stretch the bread into its
  traditional teardrop shape. using a pillowlike holder called a gaddi
  (literally "throne"), the baker presses the bread onto the walls of a hot
  tandoor. the gaddi protects his hand-a must when you consider that the
  temperature of the tandoor can reach 700°f. the bread emerges from the oven
  puffed and blistered on top and crisp and brown on the bottom. it’s sweet and
  smoky, pliable and moist, and about as delicious as bread gets.  note:  allow
  2 hours for rising.
