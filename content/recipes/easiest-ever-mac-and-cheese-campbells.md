  In our house, mac and cheese is a staple! (no, i don't have any kids.. it is i
  that loves the cheesy pasta.) based on the reviews on the campbell's website,
  this is an easy, go to, tasty recipe. what i like is that i can use whole
  grain pasta and low fat milk to make it much better than the boxed stuff. i
  have made these modifications in the listing of the recipe, but certainly use
  full fat milk (or.. dare i say.. cream!)/regular pasta if you wish. **original
  recipe calls for 1/2 can milk and 1/2 can water but i figured zaar wouldn't
  recognize that so i put about 2/3 c. it may be more accurate to use the can
  method.
