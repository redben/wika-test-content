 - Wisk eggs and water together in a bowl
 - Set aside
 - Mix all dry ingredients in a bowl
 - Pour liquid in and mix well with a fork until all ingredients are incorporated
 - The dough should be moist but not sticky and form a ball well when squeezed
 - Form dough into six balls and flatten each slightly in the palm of your hand , closing any major cracks that form at the edges
 - Place a ball of dough between two sheets of waxed paper and roll with a rolling pin until 1 / 8th of an inch thick
 - Remove one sheet of paper and flip the dough into a lightly greased frying pan on low to med heat
 - Gently remove the paper from the top of your dough
 - When it puffs slightly and browns around the edges you can flip it to toast the other side
 - Remove to a piece of paper towel to cool
 - When cool store these with sheets of wax paper between them in a ziploc bag in the fridge for 3 or 4 days
