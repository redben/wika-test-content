  Before buffalo wings had even been dreamed of, our african ancestors had their
  own type of hot flavors.  and when you use those to flavor today's popular
  chicken wings...look out!  now, you can really ratchet up the heat by adding a
  bit more crushed red pepper to this.  just be prepared for the extra zing.
