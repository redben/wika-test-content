 - Make crust: preheat over to 375f cut two 12-inch lengths of parchment paper and trim each to fit the 8-inch width of an 88-inch square baking pan
 - Press it into the bottom and sides of your pan in one direction , then use the second sheet to line the rest of the pan , perpendicular to the first sheet
 - Using rubber spatula or fork , mix melted butter , sugar , and vanilla in medium bowl , or in the bottom of the small saucepan you used to melt the butter
 - Add flour and salt and stir until incorporated
 - Transfer dough to your prepared pan , and use your finger
 - Bake the crust until golden , about 18 minutes
 - Transfer crust to rack and cool in pan
 - Maintain oven temperature
 - Make the filling: cook butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until deep nutty brown , stirring often and watching carefully , about six minutes
 - Immediately pour browned butter into glass measuring cup to cool slightly
 - Whisk sugar , eggs , and salt in medium bowl to blend
 - Add flour and vanilla and whisk until smooth
 - Gradually whisk browned butter into sugar-egg mixture
 - Whisk until well blended
 - Arrange pitted cherries , or the berries of your choice , in bottom of cooled crust
 - Carefully pour browned butter mixture evenly over the fruit
 - Bake bars until filling is puffed and golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean , about 40 minutes
 - Cool bars completely in pan on rack
 - Use the parchment paper overhang to carefully remove cooled bars from pan and place them on a cutting board and cut them into squares with a very sharp knife
 - The cherries , if they fall over your slicing lines , will want to give you trouble but if you saw a sharp knife into them slowly before pressing down , theyll cut neatly and with minimum carnage
 - Do ahead: can be made at least a day ahead , and stored at room temperature
 - Any longer , keep them cool in the fridge
