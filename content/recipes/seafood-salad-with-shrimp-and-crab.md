  This is my favorite spring and summer salad. it's a great opening act for any
  seafood dinner and it makes a really good snack or appetizer. i like it with
  captain's wafers. after mixing it, i pack it into individual 1 cup containers
  so it's ready to grab and go. i take it to work for lunch quite often. cooking
  time is chilling time.

 - Cut each shrimp into 2 or 3 pieces
 - Chop crabmeat into pieces about the size of the shrimp pieces
 - Mix all ingredeints together and chill for 4 hours to let the flavors blend
 - It looks like a lot of mayo at first but after it's chilled it doesn't look like so much
