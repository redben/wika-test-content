  This is my first original recipe, but i welcome criticism! (although my
  boyfriend had thirds and then passed out on the couch).  i knew i wanted to
  cook ham shanks in the crock pot, but i couldn't find any recipes that were
  quite what i was looking for.  the ingredients i listed here will fill a 3
  quart pot, but i imagine quantities are flexible.
