  Posting this for world tour 2016 philippines.  found on a site called
  ambitious chef.  looks yummy and it's no cook!  it calls for "thick cream". 
  the recipe below calls for heavy cream because food.com keeps changing the
  "thick cream" to heavy cream. looked it up and see that "thick cream" is
  available in some parts of the world in cans like condensed milk come in.  but
  can't find it in my area, so the best research i found said to substitute
  creme fraiche, but maybe heavy cream will work well too.
