 - Pound the chicken pieces to flatten them slightly
 - Season them with salt and pepper to taste
 - Heat an empty pan on high heat , then add the oil and one tablespoon of the margarine and allow that to get hot
 - Then carefully add the chicken , making sure the oil doesn't splatter
 - Doing this process will prevent the chicken from sticking
 - If you heat the oil and pan together , or if the pan isn't hot enough , the chicken will stick
 - Saut the chicken pieces for 1 minute on each side , or until they are cooked through
 - Transfer the chicken with tongs to a platter and cover it loosely to keep it warm
 - Pour off any remaining fat and oil from the skillet
 - Return it to the stovetop and add the remaining 1 tablespoon margarine , the sherry , and the lemon juice , and bring the mixture to a boil
 - Stir in the capers , the parsley , the paprika , and salt and pepper to taste , and spoon the sauce over the chicken
