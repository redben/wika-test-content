  Fresh strawberries are pretty delicious on their own. adding this cream
  topping makes them an elegant dessert for a dinner party. i like it with
  amaretto liqueur, you could use orange juice in place of liqueur if you
  prefer. perfect for brunch or a lovely summer dessert and easy enough for
  everyday. fresh strawberries are a must! taken from donogh.com by bob sassone
