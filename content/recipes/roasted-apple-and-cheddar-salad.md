description: >-
  Recipe from eating well and placed here for safe keeping.  they say you can
  easily sub pears for the apples if you like. . .heck, i used some of each! 
  this recipe is low carb, diabetic appropriate, low calorie, high fiber and
  gluten free - so it's a good one to serve at a party because it is sure to
  please everyone!  and don't get hung up on the endive in the recipe; i know
  it's expensive and i just subbed it out for more spinach.  i might also
  suggest a sprinkle of craisins or dried tart cherries on top; i felt it needed
  that since the apples/pears get super sweet in the oven and the tartness
  really brought everything together!  make ahead tip: cover and refrigerate
  dressing (step 2) for up to 1 week.
