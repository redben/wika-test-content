 - Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit
 - Soak dates in warm water for 15 minutes
 - Grease a 12 cup muffin tray with vegan gluten free margarine or coconut oil
 - In a small bowl , add 3 tablespoons water to the flax seed meal and let sit for 5 minutes
 - If you don't have oat flour , take rolled oats and pulse in a food processor until you have a flour
 - If you are making your own oat flour , remove this from food processor and put in a seperate bowl
 - Drain the dates and place in food processor with the pumpkin puree , maple syrup , coconut milk , cinnamon , nutmeg and ginger
 - Process until smooth - no chunks of dates remaining
 - Add the flaxseed mixture , the oat flour , and the gluten free flour to the food processor
 - Mix until combined
 - Add the baking soda and mix until just combined and then scoop into muffin trays
 - It is important to not over mix here and to start filling the muffin trays immediately after the baking soda has mixed into the batter
 - Fill each muffin cup to the halfway point
 - Place in oven and remove after 25 minutes or when you see the sides have browned a little
 - Let cool
 - Recommended topping on these is crunchy peanut butter
 - Enjoy !
