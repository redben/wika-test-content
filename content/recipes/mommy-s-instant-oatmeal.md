description: >-
  After making instant oatmeal from packs and trying to adapt the quick oats for
  years, i finally created this basic high octane (fiber & protein) recipe to
  fuel our mornings.  to accommodate changing tastes and my desire to experiment
  i mix and store the basic recipe.  the desired add-ins are mixed when i serve
  the cereal.  the recipe can also be increased to accommodate oamc.
