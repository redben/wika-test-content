 - Add the water , yeast , sugar , and a 1 / 2 cup of the flour into a mixing bowl
 - Stir well and let sit for 20 minutes
 - It will get bubbly
 - Add olive oil , salt , and 2 cups of the flour , and mix with a wooden spoon until it's together enough to turn out on to a lightly floured work surface to knead
 - Knead for about 10 minutes , while adding more flour a little at a time , to produce a soft , elastic and slightly sticky dough
 - Do not add too much flour , just enough to keep it from sticking to the work surface as you knead
 - Form the dough into a ball and place in a large oiled bowl
 - Drizzle a few drops of oil and coat the top of dough to prevent the surface from becoming dry
 - Cover with a kitchen towel and place in a warm spot for 2 hours , or until the dough doubles in size
 - Punch down the dough and divide into 2 balls and place in large zip lock plastic bags and refrigerate overnight
 - When ready to use , remove from fridge , and let the dough come up to room temperature before using
