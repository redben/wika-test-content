  Milestone's has this wonderful peach bellini (kind of like a slushy) that is
  full of flavour. we think we have come up with a perfect combination. i use a
  blender but a slushy machine would be awesome. i freeze a bunch of batches of
  the 7 up/peach mixture and take them out when they are almost frozen but still
  slushy.
