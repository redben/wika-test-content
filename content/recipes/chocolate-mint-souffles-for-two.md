  Recieved this recipe from taste of home and couldn't wait to try it.  i love
  that they only served two so perfect for dh and me when i wanted something
  special for just us.  they came together easy, were light, fluffy and oh so
  chocolate.  it calls for mint extract but i didn't have that so just used
  vanilla and it was still good.  think it'd be really good with the mint and
  maybe a little mint leave as garnish.
