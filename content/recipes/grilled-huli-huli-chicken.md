  Another recipe that i found on taste of home that i would like to try soon. 
  here is what the author state: "i got this grilled chicken recipe from a
  friend while living in hawaii. it sizzles with the flavors of brown sugar,
  ginger and soy sauce. huli mean "turn" in hawaiian. â€”sharon boling, coronado,
  california."  this serves a lot, so feel free to scale it back if needed.
