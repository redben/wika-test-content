description: "From food & wine magazine, here's what they say: i doubt mark wahlberg ate this macaroni salad to get into such sick shape to play champion boxer micky ward in his film the fighter. but thanks to his brother, chef paul wahlberg, we’ve got the recipe for the wahlberg family macaroni salad. mark says that no one makes the dish as well as their mother, alma. but you can try by making their recipe for yourself! or go to paul’s cool new mediterranean-italian restaurant, alma nove in hingham, massachusetts, where the macaroni salad is on his menu at his brother’s request. at least in pasta salad season in summer.\r\n i have tweeked this just a little. feel free to add olives, more veggies, etc. enjoy!"
