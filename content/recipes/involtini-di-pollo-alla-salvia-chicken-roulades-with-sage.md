 - Once you have thinly pounded out your chicken breasts , cut each breast into two strips {slightly wider than your bacon slices}
 - Season chicken strips with salt and pepper
 - Place 2 sage leaves onto each strip of chicken
 - Roll chicken strips
 - Roll bacon over chicken roll and secure with toothpicks
 - Continue until all pieces are rolled
 - Into a frying pan add olive oil and heat over medium heat
 - Once oil is hot , add chicken roulades and cook , turning frequently , until bacon has brown / crisped on all sides
 - Reduce heat to low and continue cooking for approximately 10-15 minutes until chicken has cooked through {cooking time will depend on thickness of chicken}
