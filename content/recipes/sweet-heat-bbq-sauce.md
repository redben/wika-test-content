description: >-
  Have you seen the ingredients list on the back of commercially-produced bbq
  sauce? high-fructose corn syrup seems to be in each and every one, and many of
  the other ingredients would need a chemical engineer to figure out. solution?
  make your own!!! we loved this homemade sauce slathered on chicken parts and
  ribs that we baked in the oven. generously brush on the sauce for the last few
  minutes of baking to get it caramelized and serve more at table-side.
