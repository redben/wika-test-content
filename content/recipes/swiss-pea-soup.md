description: >-
  Pea soup is very traditional in northern europe.  this is a swiss version. 
  they would use a ham called jambon de la borne, or hook ham, as it is hooked
  up in the huge cheese chalet chimney where people make cheese on wooden fires
  in the alps. most of us will have to do with a good smoked ham bone.  the
  recipe was adapted liberally from fxcuisine.com
