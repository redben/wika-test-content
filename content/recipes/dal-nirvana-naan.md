 - Dal:
 - Place the lentils in a pot and cover with a couple inches of water
 - Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until tender
 - Drain the lentils in a colander
 - While the lentils are boiling , mince the garlic and peel and grate the ginger
 - Return the drained lentils to the pot and add the butter , ginger , garlic , cayenne , salt and pepper
 - Add the can of tomatoes and one cup of water
 - Stir it all together , bring it to a simmer then reduce the heat to low
 - Put a lid on the pot and let it simmer for half an hour
 - The mixture should be soft and thick after a half hour
 - If it is not , continue to simmer , adding more water if it dries out
 - You want the end product to be thick , not watery
 - Stir in the evaporated milk or cream and garnish with fresh , chopped cilantro
 - Serve over rice or with naan bread for dipping !
 - Naan:
 - In a small bowl , combine the yeast , sugar and water
 - Stir to dissolve then let sit for a few minutes or until it is frothy on top
 - At that point , stir in the oil , yogurt and egg until evenly combined
 - In a medium sized bowl , combine 1 cup of the flour with the salt
 - Next , add the bowl of wet ingredients to the flour / salt mixture and stir until well combined
 - Continue adding flour a half cup at a time until you can no longer stir it with a spoon
 - At that point , turn the ball of dough out onto a well floured counter top
 - Knead the ball of dough for about 3 minutes , adding flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking
 - I ended up using about 3 cups of flour total
 - The dough should be smooth and very soft but not sticky
 - Loosely cover the dough and let it rise until double in size
 - After it rises , gently flatten the dough and cut it into 8 equal pieces
 - Shape each piece into a small ball by stretching the dough back under itself until the top is smooth and round
 - Heat a large , heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat and spray lightly with non-stick spray
 - Working with one ball at a time , roll it out until it is about 1 / 4 inch thick or approximately 6 inches in diameter
 - Place the rolled out dough onto the hot skillet and cook until the under side is golden brown and large bubbles have formed on the surface
 - Flip the dough and cook the other side until golden brown as well
 - Serve plain or brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with herbs !
 - I experimented with different skillet temperatures and found that a medium heat produces the most bubbles in the dough and does not burn the surface
