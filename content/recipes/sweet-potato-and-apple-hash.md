 - Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees
 - In a bowl toss sweet potato with olive oil
 - Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for 10 minutes or until theyre just tender but not over-cooked
 - Coat a skillet with olive oil , add onion and apples and sprinkle with salt
 - Cook over medium heat until the apples start to become tender , stirring occasionally
 - Add sweet potato and cook a few minutes longer to let everything get cooked through and let all those fall flavors come together ! remove from heat and serve
 - This is good just as it is but you could also garnish with nuts or add a protein to make it a complete meal
