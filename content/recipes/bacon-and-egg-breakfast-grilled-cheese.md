 - See cooking
 - Beat eggs , milk , salt and pepper in bowl until blended
 - Heat 1 teaspoon butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot
 - Pour in egg mixture
 - As eggs begin to set , gently pull the eggs across the pan , forming large soft curds
 - Continue cooking , pulling , lifting and folding eggs until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains
 - Do not stir constantly
 - Remove from pan
 - Clean skillet
 - Spread remaining 2 teaspoons butter evenly on one side of each bread slice
 - Place 2 slices in skillet , buttered side down
 - Top evenly with scrambled eggs , cheese and bacon
 - Cover with remaining bread , buttered side up
 - Grill sandwiches over medium heat , turning once , until bread is toasted and cheese is melted , 2 to 4 minutes
 - Cooking
 - Avoid cast iron
 - Eggs scrambled in a cast iron skillet can turn a greenish shade
 - This harmless but unappealing color change is the result of a chemical reaction between iron in the pan and sulfur in egg whites
 - Don't overcook
 - The heat retained in the pan will continue to cook and firm up the eggs after pan is removed from heat
 - How long to beat is a matter of preference
 - Light beating produces more dense scrambled eggs
 - Vigorous beating aerates the eggs , resulting in lighter fluffier curds
