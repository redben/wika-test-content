  This recipe can also be made with seafood.  this is how i make it using canned
  salmon.  the pastry crust is optional.  now that i am using almond milk (i
  like almond breeze), i will probably use that to replace the milk or cream. 
  the cook time does not include baking time for the optional pastry shell.
