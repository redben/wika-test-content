 - These are just suggestions , so please add more or less depending on your taste
 - I like my chili spicy so i tend to add more chili powder , cayenne and black pepper
 - Saute garlic over med
 - Heat using a little liquid so your garlic won't burn
 - Add beef and let brown , be sure to keep moving it around so it doesn't burn since this is extra lean beef and there is practically no fat
 - Add more liquid if you need to about a tablespoon at a time
 - While meat is browning dice up tomato and puree in blender , add a little broth or water to help it move around a little in the blender if needed
 - Once meat is brown add the tomato puree and 1 / 2 cup of the liquid
 - Begin adding spices , try a little at a time if you are unsure and then add by taste
 - Let the chili simmer on med / low heat for about 15 min or until it reaches the consistency you like
 - I like mine a little thicker so i let it cook about 15 minute
 - Suggested meal ideas: 4 stone-ground wheat thins with grilled zucchini
