  My daughter served this for a dinner party recently, and we all really liked
  it, so i asked her for the recipe.  she said she got if from her one of her
  williams-sonoma cookbooks, though i don't know which one.  but i think this
  recipe produces a wonderfully flavorful rack of lamb that we all enjoyed. i
  hope you do, too.
