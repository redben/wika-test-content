  My boyfriend grew up as an expat in indonesia and passed along this recipe to
  me. the fried egg on top with a runny yolk really makes it special. this
  recipe is very modifiable with what vegetables you want to put in, only the
  sauces, onions, garlic and chili are essential to the taste! for twice the
  amount, doubling all the portions works just fine! enjoy!
