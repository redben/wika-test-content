  This isn't the typical back-of-the-can recipe...no gooey condensed soup, no
  lifeless frozen broccoli, no sit-on-your-shelf-forever "cheese product". this
  is an irresistible casserole...delicious for a weeknight supper or worthy of a
  dinner party. it is wonderful served along with most anything...chicken, ham,
  beef, pork chops, whatever!
