  Freezes nicely, but doesn't last long. we buy the large packages of ground
  turkey at a warehouse club and make up a big batch, to save time and money.
  garlic is thought to help boost the immune system, so don't be shy with it.
  the cloves should be fresh and firm, and when mashed (with the side of the
  knife) and chopped they should smell sweet and not too pungent.
