title: Lemon Truffle Pie

description: >-
  An adaptation of the pillsbury bakeoff's cream cheese and white chocolate pie
  with a tart lemon topping, but with an easy microwave preparation.  use no
  less than a 9" cooked dough or graham cracker crust to accommodate the
  filling.  also, use the best quality lemon curd you can find or prepare your
  own.  give yourself time for the cream cheese to soften or the mixture will
  become grainy.  chill time not included.  note:  if using the graham cracker
  crust to gain a more crisp texture i highly recommend to bake the crust about
  5-10 minutes.  i like realtor's suggestion of a vanilla wafer crust.  also,
  see her easy and eggless recipe for lemon curd  recipe #429423.
