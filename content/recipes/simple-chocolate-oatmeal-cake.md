description: >-
  Posted for zwt6 german region.  this simple cake, made with oatmeal, chocolate
  chips, and coconut, is great for lunchboxes or a family dinner. it's very
  similar to german chocolate cake, but with more chocolate! and the cake is
  very easy to make because you don't have to cream butter and sugar together,
  and the topping is simply stirred together and spooned on the cake. ***
  warning *** after placing topping on the cake it is extremely important that
  you watch this cake 100% of the time or it will burn/scorch quickly.  it is a
  bit more labor intensive but turns out great with a watchful eye.
