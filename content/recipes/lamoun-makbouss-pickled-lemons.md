  A quicker way to salt cure lemons. i use olive oil, because i use these for
  savory dishes. if you'd like to use yours in a dish where the flavor of olive
  oil will be out of place, feel free to use vegetable oil instead. measurements
  are not critical. use as many lemons as it takes to fill your jar, and as much
  salt and oil as it takes to cover your lemons. feel free to add paprika,
  peppercorns, or other spices between the layers of lemons.

 - Thinly slice lemons , and place in a colander or on a cutting board set at an angle , with paper towels underneath to catch the liquid
 - Generously over with salt , and allow to sit until tender and slightly translucent
 - Arrange lemon slices in a glass jar in layers
 - I like to line the walls of the jar with vertical lemon slices , too , just to make it pretty , especially if giving as a gift
 - Pour oil in jar to cover lemons , and place lid on tightly
 - These can be used in as little as two days , but will drastically improve for up to three weeks
 - I don't really know how long they keep , because i've never had them go bad before they get used
 - Pickled lemons can be used in stews , in the cavity of roasted chickens , or chopped fine and stirred into yogurt as a lovely dip for vegetables and pita bread
