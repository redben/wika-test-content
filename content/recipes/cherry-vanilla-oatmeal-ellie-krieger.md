 - Put water , oats , salt and cherries into a medium sized saucepan
 - Bring to a boil , reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes for old fashioned oats , or 1 minute for quick cooking oats
 - Remove from heat
 - Stir in the vanilla extract and cherry jam
 - Put into serving bowls and pour 2 tablespoons of milk over each bowl
 - Personally , i add the flaxseed for an extra oomph !
