 - The best way to cook spaghetti squash is to stab it a few times with a small knife
 - Microwave on high for 7 minutes , roll it over , and nuke til it gives when you push on it
 - Cool til you can handle it
 - Chop off the stem end , cut lengthwise , scoop out the fibers and the seeds
 - With a fork , scrape out the spaghetti
 - Mix with all other ingredients and pan fry by large spoonfuls til crispy and golden brown
 - Warning -- these are addictive !
