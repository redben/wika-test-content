 - In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment , cream butter , sugars and corn syrup on medium high for 2-3 minutes until fluffy and pale yellow in color
 - Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula
 - On a lower speed , add eggs and vanilla to incorporate
 - Increase mixing speed to medium-high and start a timer for 10 minutes
 - During this time the sugar granules will fully dissolve , the mixture will become an almost pale white color and your creamed mixture will double in size
 - When time is up , on a lower speed , add the flour , baking powder , baking soda , and salt
 - Mix 45-60 sec just until your dough comes together and all remnants of dry ingredients have incorporated
 - Do not walk away from your mixer during this time or you will risk over mixing the dough
 - Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula
 - On same low speed , add in the hodgepodge of your favorite baking ingredients and mix for 30-45 sec until they evenly mix into the dough
 - Add in your favorite snack foods last , paddling again on low speed until they are just incorporated
 - Using a 6oz ice cream scoop , portion cookie dough onto a parchment lined sheetpan
 - Wrap scooped cookie dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour or up to 1 week
 - Do not bake your cookies from room temperature or they will not hold their shape
 - Heat oven to 400f
 - Arrange chilled cookie dough balls on a parchment or silpat-lined sheetpan a minimum of 4" apart in any direction
 - Bake 9-11 minutes
 - While in the oven , the cookies will puff , crackle and spread
 - At 9 min , cookies should be browned on the edges and just beginning to brown towards the center
 - Leave the cookies in the oven for the additional 2 min if the cookies still seem pale and doughy
 - Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pan before transferring to a plate or an airtight container or tin for storage
 - At room temp , cookies will keep fresh 5 days and in the freezer , 1 month
