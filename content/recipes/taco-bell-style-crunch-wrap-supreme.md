 - In a large skillet over medium-high heat , brown the ground beef until halfway cooked
 - Use the spoon only to break the ground beef into chunks
 - Remove the semi-cooked meat from the skillet and add to a food processor
 - Pulse until the meat is a finely ground consistency
 - Drain the pan of the grease that has already cooked out of the meat
 - Add the meat back to the skillet and bring it to medium heat
 - Add the onion flakes , garlic powder , cornstarch , cumin , paprika , chili powder , salt , cayenne powder and sugar
 - Cook for two minutes , stirring to evenly distribute the add-ins and then pour the water over the meat
 - Simmer uncovered until the meat is cooked through
 - While meat is simmering , transfer eight to ten tbsp of salsa con queso cheese dip into a bowl
 - Quickly zap in the microwave until it is liquid hot
 - Keep warm
 - When ready to serve , lay out one flour tortilla and add a spoonful of the meat mixture to the center then top with a similar size spoonful of cheese dip
 - Top the meat and cheese mixture with a tostada shell and plop down one tablespoon of sour cream on top
 - Add some of the tomatoes and shredded lettuce over the sour cream and then , working counter clockwise , fold the edges of the flour tortilla up over the meat , cheese , tostada , tomato , and lettuce pile
 - Continue to fold until it is completely wrapped and in the shape of a hexagon
 - Heat another medium skillet over high heat and grease with some cooking spray
 - Fry the flour tortilla on each side until it gets a nice golden brown crust
 - While one is frying , make another wrap
 - Serve with a copycat taco bell sauce , like red sauce , fire sauce or green sauce
