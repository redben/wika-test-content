 - Pound the cardamom pods to loosen the husks
 - Use a mortar and pestle to pound the seeds , releasing their flavor
 - Add the garlic , salt , and oregano
 - And continue to pound until the ingredients are well mixed
 - Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil , and continue to crush until you have a smooth paste
 - Rub 3 / 4 of the paste over the hens , making sure you cover all of their surfaces
 - Mix the remaining paste with the remaining olive oil , and pour over the birds , reserving a little bit to baste with while grilling
 - Cover and marinate for at least four and up to eight hours , turning occasionally
 - Preheat a grill to high
 - Season the birds with plenty of pepper , then place on the grill and sear being careful of flare-ups , until the skin is golden
 - Move the birds to indirect heat , and grill until completely cooked , basting with the reserved marinate during the last few minutes of cooking
