  Occasionally i come across a recipe calling for celery salt, and it's

  bottle at hand-- here's a simple substitute to yield a small bottle's worth,
  but feel free to adjust upward or downward depending on how much you need the
  proportion and method are all the same. 1 serving = 1 tsp, 12 tsp in 4 oz
