description: "This casserole is great for holidays or just special days.  it's easy, inexpensive to make and taste great.\r\ni normally put all the ingredients together (except the cresent rolls) and let sit overnight in the fridge.  this isn't a must, but i'm not a morning person and it saves time the next day."
