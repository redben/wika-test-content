  There is no comparison between canned and fresh tuna salad. the taste of fresh
  is just so good! this salad can be used as stuffing for tomatoes, avocados,
  for sandwiches or as an appetizer with crackers. it's very easy to make, too.
  i don't like my tuna salad to have a lot of mayonnaise so you may want to add
  more, to taste. you may also want to play around with the spices, sometimes
  instead of old bay i'll use chopped jalapenos or add chopped fresh herbs like
  dill and chives. *to note, one reviewer questioned the amount of time i
  suggest boiling the fish and here's my answer to that: "this recipe is not for
  a rare tuna salad, it's more of a tuna salad for sandwiches, more like the
  diner tuna salad they make out of tinned tuna, only much better. if you are in
  search of a recipe for seared tuna to use in salad nicoise, this is not it".
