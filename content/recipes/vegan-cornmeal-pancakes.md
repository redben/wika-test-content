 - Heat a non-stick frying pan or griddle over high heat
 - In a big bowl combine polenta , cornflour , spelt flour , sugar and salt
 - Add the sparkling water and vanilla extract and stir into a smooth , runny dough
 - If its too thick , add a bit more water
 - If its too thin , just stir in a bit more flour
 - Reduce the heat to medium and ladle about 1 / 4 cup batter per pancake into the skillet
 - Once bubbles rise to the surface of the pancake , flip it and cook on the other side until golden brown
 - Continue doing this until all dough has been used
 - Serve with condiments of choice
 - We especially enjoyed these with cheese and jam
