description: >-
  This is more of a technique than a recipe, as we all probably know how to make
  these separately, but the groove is in how to get them all to the plate hot at
  the same time. required is a pan and a spatula, a microwave, and a toaster.
  you think you can't have breakfast on the fly? i'll have you eating in about 5
  minutes. promise.

 - Prep: the first thing i do is get the eggs out of the fridge , the bacon and the bread
 - I try to get the eggs to room temp by putting them out early , but it isn't required
 - They may just take a bit longer to cook
 - Get your pan on the burner and pre-heat it to medium-ish
 - I start closer to medium low , then move it to medium when i'm there cooking the eggs
 - Now , the bacon
 - Ever used a microwave for your bacon ? it's too easy , trust me
 - Take 2-3 slices and place them evenly on a paper towel
 - Cover with another piece of towel and get them on a microwave safe plate
 - Times may vary for this , but my oven is 1000 watts and the bacon gets nice and crispy how i like it in two minutes , thirty seconds
 - Adjust according to yours
 - Bread
 - Simple
 - Just place two slices in the toaster ready to go
 - Cooking: you've got your eggs next to the stove and your pan on and heated , your bacon is in the microwave , and the bread is standing by in the toaster
 - Set the microwave to 2:30 and hit start , press down the plunger on the toaster , put some butter in the pan to melt , and break the eggs into the pan
 - Don't worry about the toast or bacon getting done early , as they will keep warm from residual heat in their respective cooking implements
 - We're going to concentrate on the eggs
 - You've cracked them in there and they're beginning to turn white
 - At this point , i salt them and crack some liberal pepper over them
 - To taste , of course
 - Next , you'll see a sort of raised ring , about a half inch to inch around the yolk , of white
 - I constantly take the corner of my spatula and break through this to the cooking surface
 - What that does is expose more and more white to the heat and i like this part cooked and not runny , but the yolk really runny
 - Once this has set up , you're basically done
 - Shake the pan and look to see if you have any jiggly , clear bits
 - No ? put the eggs on a plate
 - Careful getting the bacon out of the microwave and towels
 - Hot
 - Put them on the plate as well
 - Butter the toast , put them on the plate
 - Sit down and feast like a king , or queen , heheheh
 - I like to break the yolks , cut up the the eggs and mix it all together , and pile a fork full on a corner of the toast and chow down like that , occasionally taking a bite of the savory bacon for a change of tongue scenery , if you will , but you eat it however you like , heheh
