 - Preheat the oven at 350 fahrenheit
 - In a bowl smash the feta with a fork , add the yogurt and mix well and then add the egg
 - Mix in the mint and a bit of pepper and mix well
 - Put aside
 - Cut the tomatoes in thin slices
 - Take out the phyllo and a pan a bit small then the dimensions of the phyllo sheet
 - Brush some olive oil on the base of the pan and spread the phyllo sheet
 - Brush olive oil on the phyllo sheet and place another sheet brushing with olive oil every time
 - Continue this until you have used 6-7 sheets
 - Roll up the edges of the phyllo , so you have a little border around the tart
 - Spread the feta mixture evenly over the whole tart
 - Then place the tomatoes on top
 - Bake for about 30 minutes
 - Put the pan on the bottom rack of the oven during the last 5-10 minutes to get a crunchy base
 - This tastes better the next day at room temperature
