 - Add everything into a sauce pan and cook until it boils , stirring constantly
 - Continue to cook and stir until everything is dissolved and starts to thicken approximately 5 mintures
 - Cool in refrigerator until thick and set
 - Prep time does not include time in the refrigerator
 - I have never tried this , but i think you could fold in 1 1 / 2 cups of whipped heavy cream to make a frosting
 - I also wonder how this would work in a pie -- if anyone is brave enough let me know how that works
