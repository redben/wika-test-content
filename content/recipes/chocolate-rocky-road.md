description: "Who doesn't love chunks of rich dark chocolate studded with yummy edible jewels....my family just love this version of an old favourite, and the fact that it contains fruit and nuts is a little better for the children too. feel free to use your own choice of fruit and nuts etc.\r\ndon't leave out the chilli though-it's not spicy, just adds a little something to it!\r\ntry it smashed up in fine pieces on vanilla ice cream-yum!"
