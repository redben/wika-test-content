  Craving rich lasagna taste, but have no time to slave over this elaborate
  dish? not a problem. i put lazy in lasagna - you'll have it ready for the oven
  in 10 minutes or less - promise.  and... drum roll... it's made with uncooked
  egg noodles!  i came up with this idea after i spent almost an entire day
  making a lasagna from scratch. i make a great noodle kugel with uncooked egg
  noodles, so i thought - why not a lasagna?

 - Reserve about 2 / 3 cup of shredded mozzarella and 1 cup of pasta sauce
 - Brown ground beef , sausage and onion , adding crushed garlic when almost done
 - Stir in pasta sauce and all dried spices
 - In a separate bowl , combine cottage cheese , mozzarella and 2 raw eggs
 - Spread one-third of meat sauce in a lightly greased 13x9 inch baking dish
 - Follow with a layer of uncooked egg noodles
 - (simply "dump" the noodles on top of the sauce and spread with your hand to create a thin even layer , completely covering the sauce
 - Follow by a layer of the cheese mix , and a layer of meat sauce
 - Repeat procedure until all ingridients are used
 - Mix remaining pasta sauce with hot water , 50 / 50
 - Slowly pour the mixture around inside edge of dish , until the entire top layer of noodles is lightly covered with liquid
 - If necessary , simply pour the mixture straight on top
 - Don't worry - it will cook away
 - Let stand for 5 minutes before putting the dish in the oven
 - Lightly sprinkle with mozzarella
 - Tightly cover baking dish with 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil
 - Bake in a preheated 350 degree f oven for 35-40 minutes
 - Uncover
 - If the egg noodles seem cooked -- top with the remaining mozzarella
 - Bake for an additional 10 minutes , uncovered
 - Remove from oven , and let stand 10 to 15 minutes before serving
 - If you have no sausage on hand , just substitute ground beef
 - I've tried this recipe with ground turkey , and even with a mix of browned ground beef and zucchini , and it came out great
 - If you prefer - you can broil the top mozzarella layer for a couple of minutes for extra sizzle
 - Enjoy !
