  Here's what country living says,"our hot-chocolate mix, made with the finest
  cocoa and chocolate, is a cut above most store-bought varieties. fill jars
  with the mix, cover the lids with a festive swath of fabric, and include
  peppermint "stirring" sticks for added flavor and color. try adding to a
  basket with mugs, spoons, marshmallows, whipped cream and maybe a good movie!
