 - Preheat oven to 425 degrees f
 - Place potatoes with 2 of the lemons into pot of boiling wate for 5 minutes
 - Drain , then prick the lemons all over with a knife
 - Remove the parsley leaves from the stalks and save the leaves to use later
 - Stuff the chicken with the hot lemons and the stalks of the parsley
 - Season the chicken and the potatoes with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper
 - Slice the chorizo at an angle , 1 / 4 inch thick
 - Oil a roasting pan and lay the potatoes in the center , then place the chicken on top and sprinkle with the chorizo and a few of the parsley leaves
 - Drizzle the chicken with a little olive oil
 - Take a piece of wax paper and wet it so it becomes flexible , then shake it out and lay it over the top of the ingredients in the baking pan , tucking it in snugly so the juices don't escape cook in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 20 minutes
 - While the chicken and potatoes are cooking , finely chop the zest of your 2 remaining lemons , the parsley leaves and the garlic
 - Season lightly with salt and pepper and toss together to create a seasoning-type garnish
 - Remove the pan from the oven , take chicken out and put to one side to rest
 - Give the potatoes a shake and put them back in the oven for a few more minutes to crisp up
 - I set the oven to broil for this part , so the potatoes would crisp faster
 - Just keep an eye on them
 - Carve the chicken and divide between 4 plates , with the potatoes and chorizo
 - The potatoes will have taken on the smoky flavor from the chorizo , so if there is any juice left in the pan , pour every bit over the plates
 - Sprinkle over the seasoning garnish
