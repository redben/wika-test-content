description: >-
  From our april 2011 issue of sunset magazine. the original recipe specified
  fava greens although i could not locate fava greens anywhere in town (fresh
  fava beans not the leaves unfortunately). in its place-fresh baby arugula from
  our local farmers' market .  i think other greens such as watercress, mache,
  heirloom lettuce, baby spinach, etc would work well in this salad recipe. the
  flowers of lavender, rosemary, mustard, chives, etc. or other various edible
  herbs can be substituted for the borage flowers if the latter is not
  available. simple elegance and very pretty!
