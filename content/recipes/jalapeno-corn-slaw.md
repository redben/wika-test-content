 - Roast red bell pepper either over a gas flame until it blisters or in a skillet with 2 tablespoons oil and blister over high heat
 - Wrap in a wet paper towel and set aside to steam gently
 - When you remove the towel , most of the skin should come off with it
 - Scrape off the rest of the skin with a butter knife
 - For corn , place "unshucked" ears of corn in an oven and set at 350 degrees - roast for 30 minutes or until kernels are soft
 - Shuck the corn , remove the silk , cut the kernels from the cob and proceed as directed
