  Recipe from eating well magazine and it is simply divine!  so summery and
  fruity, yet not overly sweet.  you can definitely make this non-alcoholic by
  simply omitting the gin.  they also recommend this pretty pink cocktail to be
  served at bridal showers.

 - Puree the watermelon
 - Strain
 - Divide the juice among 4 tall ice-filled glasses
 - Top each glass with 1 1 / 2 ounces gin , 2 tablespoons lime juice and 1 / 3 cup ginger ale
 - Garnish with the lime wedges
 - I find that this amount makes 5 large drinks
