 - Vinaigrette: in a container , whisk together the vinegars , sugar , sweet mustard , salt and vanilla
 - Whisk in the oil
 - Makes a generous 1 cup of vinaigrette
 - Salad: arrange the romaine on individual salad plates
 - To prepare the peeled and cored apples , cut each half into 1 / 4-inch thick slices , then cut each slice into thirds
 - Place the apples in a small bowl and toss with enough of the vinaigrette to coat the pieces
 - You can prepare the apple mixture up to an hour ahead
 - Important: if you coat the apples with the dressing any longer than that , they will absorb too much of the vinaigrette , which overwhelms the apple flavor
 - Divide the apple mixture among the salads
 - Top each serving with a portion of the cheese and then a portion of the hazelnuts
 - Drizzle an extra bit of the vinaigrette over the greens and around the edges of the salad
 - Serve
 - Alternatively: instead of hearts of romaine lettuce , consider a mixture of baby spinach , hearts of romaine and / or other mixed young greens
 - You could also substitute feta or white cheddar , aged gouda , etc
 - For the blue cheese
 - Another serving option would be to assemble the entire salad on a large platter instead of individual salad plates
