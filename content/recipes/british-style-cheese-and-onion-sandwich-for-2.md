description: >-
  About a week ago i found a really good quality imported "extra mature
  farmhouse cheddar" cheese from the uk and decided to test it in this recipe
  which was recently featured on thekitchn.com. use the best ingredients you can
  if at all possible: homemade bread and mayonnaise, etc. q: i don't intend to
  step on any toes (especially british ones) but don't you think bacon/rashers
  would be delicious in this sandwich? a. yes. the bacon is optional of course.
  the husband discovered my secret stash of the farmhouse cheddar cheese and now
  most of it is gone! :/ serving suggestion that we enjoyed with our sandwiches:
  recipe #272915, hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit. i believe this is my first
  english recipe posted here but the fine english people have no cause for
  concern.

 - Grate the cheese
 - Combine in a bowl with the onions and mayonnaise
 - Add salt and pepper to taste
 - Spread the mixture between slices of buttered bread
 - If adding the optional bacon , arrange the slices on the bread
 - The filling also makes an excellent topping for baked potatoes
