  When i flipped my 2011 betty crocker calendar to may, i found a delicious
  looking photo and recipe for tacos that used baked beans, chicken, and bacon. 
  immediately i thought, "why haven't we tried something like this?"  it's right
  up our alley!  i ended up making some changes, so this the variation we use,
  inspired by that drool-worthy photo in the calendar.  use your favorite
  homemade or canned baked beans!  omit the jalapeno if you want to keep it
  mild, or remove its seeds and ribs.  we like a little zip.
