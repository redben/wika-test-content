  Being on a budget doesn't limit one to deprive himself of delicious meals.
  this is a healthy tweak on fried rice, but without any meat. initially
  suspicious that i would miss the meat, the contrary was proven! this recipe
  can also be transformed into a vegan-friendly version by simply substituting
  the chicken stock for vegetable stock. enjoy!

 - Rinse the drained chickpeas in a colander and pat dry with a paper towel
 - Remove the skins
 - Dissolve the saffron threads in the chicken stock
 - Then , heat the olive oil in a large pan and add the garlic and shallots
 - Cook for about 3 minutes
 - Add the carrots , chickpeas and paprika powder and stir
 - Cook until the shallots have slightly browned
 - Afterwards , add the rice and chicken stock
 - Cover the pan with its lid and cook on low heat for about 13 minutes
 - Don't forget to stir the rice sometimes , to prevent sticking and burning !
 - Add the broccoli and tomatoes quickly , and let it cook for 4 more minutes
 - Don't get scared if almost all the liquid seems evaporated
 - At last , add the frozen peas , black pepper and salt and cook for 2 minutes
 - Finish to taste if necessary
 - For best results , make this dish one night ahead ! all the spices and flavors are better absorbed , making it tastier when serving it the next day
