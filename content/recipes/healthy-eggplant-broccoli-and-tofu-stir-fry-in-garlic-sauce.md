 - In a bowl , prepare sauce: combine heated broth and cornstarch , stirring to dissolve
 - Add vinegar , soy sauce , brown sugar , and red pepper flakes
 - Set aside
 - In another bowl , toss eggplant in a few shakes of salt
 - Let eggplant cubes sit in salt for 20-30 minutes , then rinse with water and pat dry
 - Doing this eliminates the slightly bitter taste eggplant sometimes has
 - Set prepared eggplant cubes aside
 - Heat oil in a large skillet or wok on stovetop
 - Add minced garlic and diced onion and fry until onion becomes golden or translucent
 - Add broccoli and stir-fry about 2 minutes , adding more oil or broth if veggies begin to stick to pan
 - Add cubed tofu and continue to cook 1-2 minutes
 - Then add cubed eggplant and keep cooking 4-5 minutes , stirring to keep from sticking to the pan bottom
 - Finally , turn heat down to medium or a simmer
 - Stir the sauce you've prepared , and then pour it into the pan
 - Continue to cook until the sauce thickens nicely
 - Serve and enjoy !
