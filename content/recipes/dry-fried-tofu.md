 - First of all , make sure you have the water-packed tofu , not the silken tofu that comes in the aseptic boxes
 - Heat a non-stick pan or a very well-seasoned cast-iron pan over medium heat , if you have an electric stove , or low to medium-low on a gas stove
 - Cut your tofu in half lengthwise
 - Place it between paper towels or clean dish towels and press gently
 - Cut into about 16 triangles or strips
 - Add the tofu pieces to the pan
 - Leave plenty of room around each piece
 - Cook very slowly over low to medium heat
 - Slow cooking is the key to ensuring the tofu doesn't stick to the pan and that the water has time to evaporate so that the tofu can brown
 - Do not use oil
 - What you want to do is leach all the water out of your tofu in a dry pan
 - As the tofu cooks , frequently use a spatula to press down on the top of each piece
 - You should see some water squeezing out and sizzling in the pan
 - When the bottom sides are firm and golden , carefully flip the pieces and repeat the same process on the other sides
 - They are done when they are firm and golden on both sides
 - Now that your tofu has given up most of its water , it is perfectly ready to soak up any marinade like a sponge
 - Place the cooked tofu pieces in your marinade of choice , stir , and let sit for about half an hour
 - Now your tofu is ready to eat or to use in a stir-fry !
 - Uncooked leftover tofu should be placed in a container that has a lid , submerged in water , sealed , and stored in the fridge
 - Try to remember to change the water every day or two until you use it
 - Cooked tofu can be stored like any other leftovers
