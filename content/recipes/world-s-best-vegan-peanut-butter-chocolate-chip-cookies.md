  I have a recipe in my box so old and used it's hard to read so i've decided to
  copy it here for all eternity.  originally a non-vegan recipe, i've modified
  it over the years to match my healthier lifestyle.  if you don't have
  turbinado sugar, brown sugar will do.  and yes, all purpose flour *will* work,
  but whole wheat pastry flour is better for you.  if you do decide to use ap
  flour, omit the soy or almond milk.  i'm embarrassed to say that i've never
  actually counted the cookies this recipe makes as the size i make depends on
  my need for chocolate on a given day.  i'll guess it's 3 dozen, ymmv. hope you
  enjoy this recipe as much as my family does.

 - Preheat your oven to 350
 - Mix egg replacer with water until very smooth and set aside
 - I love brm but if you have a different favorite egg substitute , use that
 - Cream the margarine and peanut butter together
 - Add the sugar and egg replacer , add the soda , salt and vanilla
 - When all is smooth , add in the flour
 - Whole wheat pastry flour is much dryer than normal all purpose flour , so once it's been incorporated , add in 1 / 3 cup of soy or almond milk a bit at a time until you have a smooth dough
 - Turn in your chocolate and nuts , if desired
 - Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes
