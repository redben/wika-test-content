  Adapted from recipe made by curtis stone on nbc today show. preparation time
  includes time to marinate the pork.  sriracha hot sauce is a thicker hot sauce
  as opposed to tabasco sauce.  you can find it in the asian section of most
  large grocery stores.  note:  i have made these sandwiches a few times and you
  can also you boneless pork chops, fat removed and each boneless chop cut into
  several super thin fillets. once filleted, use a meat mallet to tenderize each
  fillet and to flatten further.
