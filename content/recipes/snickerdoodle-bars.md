  I have tried some other snickerdoodle bar-type recipes, but they were too
  sweet and too cake-like for my family's taste.  after some experimentation,  i
  came up with these.  warning...addictive!  they taste even better when they
  have cooled.  these are a great cookie if you want to make something ahead of
  time that will keep well and taste great for days!
