  Yum. made this recipe up this morning, based on my usual scone recipe, but i
  goofed with the amount of oats and it was a happy mistake!  i hope you like
  them!  i should note that this is a more healthy, grainy, scone, not a buttery
  & flaky one - dh & i have really come to enjoy this for a more
  stick-to-your-ribs scone.  edited nov '10 to only fresh or frozen cranberries,
  as the moisture is essential to the scone's texture.
