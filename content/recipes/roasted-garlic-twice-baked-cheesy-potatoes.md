  I saw the original recipe in a kraft food & family magazine.  i have used it
  numerous times since then, and changed it a bit to meet our tastes.  here's
  what we usually do.  the bacon can be easily subbed with vegetarian bacon,
  which i do frequently for our vegetarian guests.  this is a favorite for our
  game watching!

 - Preheat oven to 400f
 - Place each potato and head of garlic onto its own piece of foil , which should be large enough to fully wrap around the potato or garlic
 - Prick the potatoes several times one each side with a fork
 - Cut off the top of the garlic to expose the top of the cloves
 - Drizzle each potato and the heads of garlic with olive oil
 - Move to oven and bake for an hour
 - Remove the potatoes and garlic from the oven and reduce heat to 350f
 - Unwrap each potato and halve the short way
 - Cut off a small bit on each of the smaller , round ends so that they will sit up straight
 - Gently scoop out the potato flesh , leaving a thin edge all the way around the cup
 - Avoid breaking the potato skin
 - Mash the potato flesh in a medium bowl
 - Add sour cream , processed cheese , and pepper , and beat until fluffy
 - Stuff mixture into the cups - it will be quite full , so mound on top as needed
 - Return to oven and bake for an additional 25 minutes , until heated through and cheese has melted
 - Top each potato half with a remaining piece of cheese and return for an additional 5 minutes , or until the cheese on top has melted
 - Garnish the potatoes with bacon and green onions before serving
