  This is a recipe that i have copied and modified from
  www.vegandad.blogspot.com.  i never liked fish very much, before i became a
  vegetarian, and this does taste like fish, but i cut back on the amount of
  seaweed and i quite enjoy the sandwich.  the kelp granules and green onions
  are optional.  if you are vegan, use vegenaise; if you are vegetarian you can
  use mayonnaise.  it is really easy to make.  serve with a vegetable soup for a
  complete vegetarian meal.
