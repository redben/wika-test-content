  My family decided to make a butternut squash lasagna for thanksgiving as our
  vegetarian main dish and i was not completely satisfied with any of the
  recipes i saw on zaar. some of them were too complicated or too high in fat
  and made with heavy cream or too low calorie and bland. so i took bits and
  pieces from each recipe and came up with this one. i originally made it in a
  9x9 inch pan so i'm not completely certain about the following measurements.
  one serving is 1/4 of a 9x9 inch pan and has about 300 calories.
