description: "You may recognize this easy to split recipe as a twist from a mainstream heavy hitter in the condiment aisle. this is the first and only potato salad i have ever, or will ever make. this is also the first recipe i ever made. -- if you're like me, this is for a bbq. this will be enough to take to the party, and have some left at home to enjoy. or one really big shin dig! party on! \r\n\r\nmake this the night before for best results! \r\n\r\ngood source of vitamin c (20% dv) and iron (6% dv)."

 - Wash and chop onion and celery heart
 - Wash and eye the potatoes
 - Leave most of the skin for vitamins
 - Cut into bite size cubes and place in a large cooking pot
 - Cover with cold water , enough so the potatoes have about one inch under the water
 - Salt generously and bring to a boil
 - Reduce heat to medium and boil for 8-10 minutes until tender
 - A little under cooked is ok because they will continue cooking
 - Rinse with cool water
 - I usually dump out all the hot water and fill with cold replacing it a few times until potatoes are cool to the touch
 - Drain and pat dry
 - Mix mayo , vinegar , salt , sugar and pepper in large bowl
 - Add potatoes , celery , onion and eggs and toss gently
 - Chill overnight
 - Mix & serve
 - Top with dill for a fancy presentation
