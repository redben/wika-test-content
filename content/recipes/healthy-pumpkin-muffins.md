  As an avid health nut who also loves all things sugary and baked, i have
  adapted this recipe from the avid appetite to fit the bill to a tee.
  absolutely delicious! ( i used all organic ingredients, but you can certainly
  use conventional ones, as well) they are pictured here with an optional
  crumble topping.

 - Preheat oven to 350 degrees and prepare your muffin tin with either liners or oil
 - Whisk together the flour , baking powder , baking soda , salt and pumpkin pie spice
 - With a mixer , combine the egg , sugar , yogurt , pumpkin , applesauce , and vanilla
 - Mix in the flour mixture until just combined
 - Stir in the walnuts
 - Pour into the muffin tin and if you're using the crumble topping place a spoonful on each muffin
 - Bake for 20-25 minutes , or until a toothpick comes out clean
 - I have young children who can be finicky about nuts in their muffins , so i will often put my walnuts in the food processor and make them fine so the added nutrients are there , but it's hidden
 - If you do this , be sure to measure the nuts first , then process away !
 - Crumble topping:
 - Place walnuts in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped
 - Add the oats and give it a quick pulse or two
 - In a bowl , combine the flour , brown sugar , and walnut mixture
 - Cut in the butter until the mixture looks like coarse bread crumbs
 - Place on top before baking
