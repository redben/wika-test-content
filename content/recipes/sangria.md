 - My
 - Use spanish rioja wine
 - I go a bit heavier with el presidente brandy and go a bit easier on the fruit juices since that was what i was taught
 - I can see where some would prefer a sweeter version but me , i like the juice from the fruit to add their signature flavors , not anything else
 - Make sure to let it sit for several hours before serving
 - A definite party-maker !
 - I made it for 50 servings & everyone absolutely loved it ! no sugar & used gingerale instead of carbonated water
 - Used rum , not brandy
 - Used peach schnapps , not triple sec
 - Refrigerated all ingredients night before
 - Made it early that afternoon & sat container in an ice chest
 - Added cold gingerale just prior to serving
 - Sooooo good ! can't wait to have another party !
