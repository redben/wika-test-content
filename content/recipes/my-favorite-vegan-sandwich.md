description: >-
  I always make this for lunch when we go camping, and my (non-vegan)
  brother-in-law and father-in-law have absolutely fallen in love with it. 
  these measurements are estimates.  just eyeball it.  feel free to experiment
  with different flavors of hummus and add other veggies to your heart's
  content.
