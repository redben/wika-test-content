  Found in healthy cooking magazine.  i have not tried this particular recipe
  but it sounds so good that i have to save it here to try later.  the recipe
  calls for walnuts but i'll probably sub out for almonds...feel free to use the
  nut you like best. definitely a biscotti that sounds great to dip into my
  coffee or tea!  prep. time includes time to refrigerate dough so don't let
  that frighten you.
