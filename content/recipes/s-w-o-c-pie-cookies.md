description: >-
  This recipe is dedicated to andi of longmeadow farm (chef #428885) and her
  beloved cows (see that backwards is swoc).  a friend made these for a fun
  afternoon treat and i fell in love.  when i asked what they were called she
  said cow pie cookies.  i immediately thought of andi and her love of all
  things swoc.  so i'm posting this since i could not find a recipe just like it
  and especially in honor of sweet andi.  the amount of cookies is a complete
  guess at this point.
