 - Using a proofed 100% hydrated starter , make the sponge in a large bowl
 - Cover and let sit on counter for 5 to 12 hours at room temperature
 - Longer times means a more sour bread
 - Add the dough ingredients to the sponge and mix well
 - Cover and rest for 20 minutes
 - Knead by hand for about 5 minutes adding water or flour to keep the dough tacky , not sticky
 - Place in a bowl that has been sprayed with oil and cover to let rise
 - I have a spot that averages 80 f for this and it's ideal
 - Stretch and fold every 40 minutes and return to rising , covered
 - When 1
 - 5 times it's original volume , divide and form 2 loaves
 - If freeform , use a rising baskedt or a floured , cloth covered colander
 - Rest for 1 hour 30 minutes at 80 f or until it increased in size by 1
 - 5 times
 - Preheat oven and a pan on the bottom of the oven for water to generate steam
 - As loaves are placed in the oven , add 2 / 3 cup of hot water to the pan
 - I invert the loaves onto parchment , score and set on a baking stone , but a sheet pan can be used
 - Bake at 375 for about 50 minutes until 205 f internal temperature
 - I rotate the loaves after 15 minutes and remove the steam pan at that time
 - Cool on racks
