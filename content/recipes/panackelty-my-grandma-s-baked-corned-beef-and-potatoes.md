  My grandma's recipe, an easy and tasty way mid-week meal made with corned
  beef, potatoes and onions - simple and packed with flavour. panackelty is a
  corruption of the word pan haggerty; panackelty is a baked dish consisting of
  meat, usually corned beef, bacon or lamb chops, and root vegetables (mainly
  potatoes and onions) which is left to bake throughout the day in a pot on low
  heat. originating in the sunderland area of north east england, the dish was a
  favourite of working-class families and was traditionally eaten on monday as
  the leftover meat and vegetables from the previous dayâ€™s meal could be used. a
  local version of the popular dish of shepherd's pie or cottage pie. i have a
  vegetarian recipe for this recipe, recipe #423399. historical note: the
  families of miners and shipyard workers would often prepare this meal as it
  could be slow cooked by a housewife during the day while she continued with
  other household tasks. a hungry worker coming home would also be especially
  satisfied with the high in fat and carbohydrate content of the dish. there are
  endless interpretations of the dish, with different families using different
  ingredients. other popular panackelty concoctions will include bacon,
  sausages, black pudding, beef stock, and occasionally pork or lamb chops and
  additional vegetables such as carrots. the vegetarian version is called pan
  haggerty, and it is thought that the meat version is a corruption of that
  word.
