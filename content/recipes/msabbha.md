  When i would visit palestine during the summers, we would walk down the street
  to our favorite restaurant samer's in the morning and get a plate of msabbha
  to go along with our fresh falafel and pickles.  along with a cup of tea this
  is a great dish that works great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!!
