  This was soooo yummy!  ina does not claim that it is authentic irish soda
  bread but says it is delicious and we agree!  next time i'll make it into two
  smaller loaves since it's pretty big for the two of us.  we had it for
  breakfast hot out of the oven yesterday and this morning we toasted it and
  just loved it!  it took more than the 4 cups of flour called for but we had to
  sift a huge restaurant sack of flour that looked more like plaster of paris,
  so it could have been because of the double sifting.  try this if you like
  soda bread!
