description: "From australian better homes and gardens diabetic living.  the recipe is for 2 as a main but you could halve on the diagonal and serve 4 as an entree/starter.  suggested you serve with steamed greens but personally i think i would prefer a simple green salad.\r\n\r\nhave included 15 minutes cooling time in the cooking time."
