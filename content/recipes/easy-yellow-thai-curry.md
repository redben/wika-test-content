description: "This recipe originally appeared on a food blog called \"7th kitchen,\" but i've modified it a little. my version doesn't have any milk in it and less coconut milk, too, so it's not as saucy. the sauce in this version is really rich and delicious, and i was thrilled by how easy it is to make.\r\n\r\ni used maesri brand yellow curry paste. i can't vouch for any other brand but this one makes a really delicious curry."
