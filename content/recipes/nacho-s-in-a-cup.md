 - Cook the ground beef on medium to high heat in a non stick pan until brown and no longer pink
 - Drain the ground beef and rinse your pan and add beef back to your pan
 - Pour the jar of salsa into beef mixture and let simmer until the beef fully absorbs the sauce
 - The longer you let simmer the better it will taste
 - While the mixture is cooking , heat oven to 350 degrees and place a cooking sheet on any flat oven pan
 - Place the tostitos scoop cups facing up in on the pan
 - Once the mixture is ready you can spoon it into tostitos scoop cups and sprinkle with the cheddar cheese
 - Cook in the oven until the cheese is melted
 - Place each scoop cup on a platter and you can either leave sour cream or guacamole on the side or add to each cup
