 - Youll need a water bath canner with a lid and basket / lifter , a clean funnel to fill your jars , eight ounce glass canning jars , screw bands and inner lids , plus probably another jar to put in your fridge or can in a separate water bath
 - Wash all of your equipment
 - Sterile equipment in a clean environment is your best friend when preserving any food
 - Wash your jars , lids and screw bands in hot soapy water
 - Fill your canner with hot water , put the lifter in and cover and heat on high to boiling
 - Fill a tea kettle or other pot with water and heat in case you need to add water to the canner once the jars are submerged and also for some boiling water to soften the lids
 - Put your jars in the lifter and submerge them until you are ready to fill them
 - Dry the screw bands and place the lids in a small pan
 - Once the kettle is boiling pour some boiling water over the lids to soften the rubber seals
 - In a large non-reactive pot mix the peaches , lemon juice and sugar
 - Once the sugar is dissolved add the butter which will reduce foaming
 - Heat over med-high to high heat stirring constantly until it reaches a boil that doesnt stop when you stir
 - Stir in the pectin and boil one minute
 - Add the amaretto and stir inches remove from the heat and skim any foam off with a metal spoon
 - Remove the jars from the canner and invert on a clean dish towel to drain
 - Turn over and fill to within 1 / 4&#8243
 - From the rim
 - Wipe the rims with a clean hot dishcloth and put the lids on rubber seal against the clean jar rims
 - Add a screw band and tighten just until you get resistance- finger
 - Put the jars in the lifter of the canner and then submerge them
 - Add boiling water if needed to cover the jars by 1-2&#8243
 - Of water
 - Return the canner to a gentle rolling boil and process for 10 minutes if sea level
 - I have to add 10 minutes for altitude
 - Consult an altitude chart on your pectin package to adjust for your altitude
 - Once the process time is over turn off the heat and leave the jars submerged for another 5 minutes
 - Lift the lifter out of the water and transfer the jars without touching the lids to an clean towel on your counter or other heatproof surface
 - Leave for 12-24 hours for the jam to gel and the lids to seal
 - You should hear a soft plonk when each seals label and store
 - Refrigerate and use immediately any that do not seal
