description: "If you're dating a vegan and you're a bacon-lover, you know what a pain in the keister making something romantic and delicious for them can be. this recipe actually tastes good to people who like food for food's sake; even tony bourdain would eat it and like it.\r\n\r\ni made it up, because periodically i throw down on the vegan challenge just for fun (vegan challenge: can you make something both delicious and vegan, with no weird processed vegan foods in it ).\r\n\r\nif it was summer, i'd use fresh tomatoes and make a tomato lasagne. since this was made in the winter, it's made with seasonal veggies - spinach, eggplant, mushrooms etc."
