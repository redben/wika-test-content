 - Separate the eggs , with the egg whites in one bowl and the egg yolks in another
 - Whip the egg whites together with the salt until very stiff
 - You should be able to turn the bowl over without the egg whites moving
 - Mix the egg yolks and the cream cheese well
 - If you choose , add the psyllium seed husk and baking powder
 - Gently fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mix try to keep the air in the egg whites
 - Put 6 large or 8 smaller oopsies on a baking tray
 - Bake in the middle of the oven at 150 c for about 25 minutes until they turn golden
 - You can eat oopsies as bread or use them as a bun for a hotdog or hamburger
 - You can also put different kinds of seeds on them before baking them , for instance poppy , sesame or sunflower seeds
 - One big oopsie can be used for a swiss roll: add a generous layer of whipped cream and some berries
 - Enjoy
