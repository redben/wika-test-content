  I discovered a recipe in joy of cooking and tweaked it a bit.  i'm not sure
  it's worth the trouble of stuffing the squash.  personally, i'd just peel and
  dice the squash while it's raw, then roast the squash while sauteeing the rest
  of the filling, then toss the whole mess in a baking dish and be done with
  it.  but, if you're into fancy presentation, go for it. :)  no matter what, it
  tastes great, and it's nutritious.
