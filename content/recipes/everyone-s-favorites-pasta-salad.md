  This pasta salad is a nice side or even as a standalone main dish.   it is
  good warm or cold and gets even more flavorful the longer it sits.  add or
  substitute your family’s favorite ingredients as this is a very flexible
  recipe. i use san giorgio’s trio italiano pasta but you can use penne, rotini,
  ziti, small shells etc. it makes a lot so it is very good for potlucks and
  cookouts.
