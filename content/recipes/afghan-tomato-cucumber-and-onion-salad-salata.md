  "salata is always light and crunchy, making it a perfect counterpoint to
  afghan cuisine’s heavier dishes. some afghan cooks consider it a point of
  pride when the diced vegetables are small and uniform in size. the result
  reminds a little of a colorful bowl of confetti. for those in afghanistan who
  can afford fresh vegetables, salata is a staple on the afghan table. if you
  can’t get your hands on any decent tomatoes, hang onto the recipe until you
  can." modified recipe off http://www.afghancooking.net by humaira ghilzai and
