 - Preheat the oven to 350f line 12 muffin cups with cupcake liners
 - Put the flour , baking powder , salt , and sugar in a large bowl and whisk lightly to aerate and combine
 - Mix the egg , yogurt , milk , and melted butter together in a pitcher
 - Pour them into the dry ingredients and mix lightly , stopping as soon as everything is combined it's essential not to overmix or you'll get dense , cakey muffins
 - Add 2 / 3 of the lemon curd in 6 or 7 dollops and quickly "marble" it lightly through the mixture
 - If your lemon curd is a bit stiff , just add it in little blobs
 - Spoon the mixture into the muffin cups , to three-quarters fill them
 - Bake for about 30 minutes , until golden brown
 - Transfer to a wire rack to cool
 - Eat on the day you bake them , ideally while still slightly warm , topped with another dollop of lemon curd
