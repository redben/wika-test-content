description: >-
  After looking on the internet for days for a chick-fil-a copycat and finding
  only plain old fried chicken recipes, i decided to try and imitate it myself.
  it came out pretty darn close i think! there are two crucial ingredients
  chick-fil-a uses that most recipes dont have- pickle juice and sugar. they
  also use msg- but its also ok without it if you dont like it. just cut up the
  breasts into chunks and follow recipe for nuggets. (edit: i also have to say i
  love chick- fil-a and that i think they're a great company. i encourage anyone
  to visit if they can, the staff is always so nice and polite at every location
  i've been to! its just too bad they don't have more locations!)

 - Pound chicken breasts till they are thin enough for your taste
 - Cut into chunks if you want nuggets
 - Place chicken in plastic bag with pickle juice and marinate for an hour
 - Mix up eggs in seperate bowl for the egg wash
 - Mix flour and remaining spices in another shallow bowl
 - Remove chicken from the pickle juice maranade and drain well
 - Dip into the egg wash and then into the flour mixture
 - Fry the chicken however you prefer here
 - I pan fried mine in a few tablespoons of oil and it turned out fine
 - Chick-fil-a deep fries theirs in a pressure cooker , so you can try that if you are feeling adventurous
