description: "I request this soup to be made every time my husband and i go visit his parents. mike, aka mickey, makes this soup up especially for me every time! he had given me the recipe years ago, but i had not made it myself until i made it for the first time last week. as with any recipe, i have to change up at least one thing, bad habit. when i made it, the only thing i did differently was to make up my own homemade turkey stock from the leftover turkey breast carcass we had from thanksgiving. couldn't see it going to waste!\r\nfeel free to change up anything to your own taste or make this soup as is!! either way, it's delicious!!!"

 - In a large soup pot , brown the ground turkey in a little bit of olive oil so it doesn't stick and break it up into small pieces
 - Add diced onion , cook until it starts to soften a bit
 - Add in desired amount of broth
 - Next , add your vegetables
 - If using potatoes , i recommend adding them in last , after the celery and carrot start to soften a bit
 - Then add to taste , your herbs and seasonings
 - Cook until all the vegetables are tender
 - May cook covered or uncovered
 - If uncovered , it will reduce a bit and the flavors will intensify more
 - Serve over warm cooked rice or orzo , a sprinkle or two of parmesan cheese and a dash of hot sauce and enjoy !
