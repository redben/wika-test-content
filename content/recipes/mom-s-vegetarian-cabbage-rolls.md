  Mom makes great cabbage rolls!  so, when i went vegetarian 23 years ago, all
  was not lost, as mom started making her cabbage rolls for me without meat. 
  essentially, they are just that - cabbage rolls without the meat, and i just
  love them.  a couple of years ago, she added veggie grounds (soy ground
  "beef") to them, and i guess i just love them the regular way, because i
  didn't like that addition - but, i'll leave that up to you, since you've not
  spent 23 years enjoying them the regular way.  the other fantastic benefit of
  having mom make vegetarian cabbage rolls just for me, is that while the rest
  of the family argues over who gets the leftovers, i get the whole pot of
  vegetarian ones just for me!  :o)

 - Cover , and steam on stove until cabbage is pliable
 - Cool cabbage enough to handle
 - Cook rice in 2 cups of water only until al dente
 - Cut each leaf from stem
 - Remove thick stem part of leaf
 - At this point decide whether you would like small cabbage rolls or larger ones
 - Cut each leaf accordingly
 - Set aside
 - Chop onion , celery , tomato and mix with rice and vegetarian ground beef , if using , and salt and pepper to taste
 - Pour a small portion of the tomato liquid from the can in to the bottom of the roasting pan
 - Place one layer of the cabbage leaves over the liquid to prevent any burning or browning of the cabbage rolls
 - Place about two tablespoons depending on the size of the leaf in to the middle of one of the cooked leaves
 - Fold one side over , then the ends
 - Roll up tightly over the fourth side
 - Place each cabbage roll tightly beside each other in to the pan
