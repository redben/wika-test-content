description: "A wonderful fusion of flavors!  i have tried dozens of greek salad recipes, and so often they taste overly oily or plain.  i have put together what i feel is the best of what i have made before and this is what i have come up with.  (i need to write it down before i lose the scrap of paper i scribbled it on).   i make a triple batch and keep it in the fridge... in a recycled store bought salad dressing bottle!  i won't be buying greek dressing ever again.\r\nnote: (i believe that recipezaar's nutritional information for this recipe is way out of wack... will investigate)"
