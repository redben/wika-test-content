  Found in the magazine cooking for two spring 2006.  another simple and
  delicious recipe.  i am writing as posted but i generally mince some garlic
  and  a few red pepper flakes (for some zing)  and add to the onion when
  sauting in butter.  i also season the fish with a little old bay seasoning and
  use panko crumbs for the saltines.
