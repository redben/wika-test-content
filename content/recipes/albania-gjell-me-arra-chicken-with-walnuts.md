  This recipe is from week four of my food blog, "travel by stove." i am
  attempting to cook one meal from every country on earth, and albania is my
  fourth stop. this is actually a very simple recipe consisting of chicken with
  a thick walnut sauce. you can cook the breasts whole or dice them first.

 - Cook the chicken breasts in olive oil until they are done
 - When the chicken is done , take it out of the pan and add the flour
 - Keep stirring until brown , then add half of the butter , garlic , walnuts and egg yolks
 - Continue to stir--you don't want the yolks to solidify
 - If your recipe turns out like mine did , you will end up with a kind of lump of walnuts
 - Although the original recipe did not call for chicken stock , i found i had to add some just to get it to a sauce-like consistency
 - Just use as much as it takes to make the sauce smooth -- more if you like a watery sauce
 - When it's ready , remove from the heat and add the chicken , stirring to coat
