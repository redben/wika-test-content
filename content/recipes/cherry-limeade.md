  I have given up sodas because of all of the chemicals that they have in them,
  but i still want carbonation once in awhile. i find all-natural and organic
  sodas to be really expensive so i am working on creating an all-natural cherry
  limeade recipe to satisfy my craving. it is important that all of your
  ingredients are cold in order to retain as much carbonation as possible.
  please feel free to make improvements and let me know what you did.
