  Utterly delicious seasonal squares. gooey and crisp at the same time with a
  lovely gooseberry tartness. i made these because i absolutely love
  gooseberries and couldn't find many recipes on how to use them other than the
  few i already knew. for the uninitiated, gooseberries are like bitter green
  marbles...i know tempting...but, once you treat them with sugar and heat they
  given out a unique taste that's hard to describe. kind of like if you crossed
  a kiwi with some rhubarb...but nicer.
