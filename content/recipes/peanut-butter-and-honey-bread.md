description: >-
  My family loves the combination of peanut butter, honey, and bananas, so i
  decided to make it into a bread. make sure to use all natural peanut butter
  and feel free to add more chopped nuts or chocolate chips if you desire. this
  recipe works well for small loaves or muffins of any size.
