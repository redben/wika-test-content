description: >-
  I came up with this as a side for a fish curry we ate last night. i have a
  hand held tool that shreds carrots in long strips. you could just grate the
  carrot if  you don't have the same. i'm in a remote area so used dried mint,
  feel free to use fresh as i would if i could get it!
