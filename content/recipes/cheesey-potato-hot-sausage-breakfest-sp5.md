description: "Official contest entry: simply potatoes 5fix.  i made this one morning camping, i usually make fried potatoes & eggs\r\nfor everyone, but now i use simply potatoes, so much easier plus you can use the different brands they sell. my favorite is southwest style.  no chopping onions, red, & green bell peppers up  :-) i use hot sausage links cooked and browned ahead of time. usually the day before,  i slice them like a 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick and save in fridge for the morning."
