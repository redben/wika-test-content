  Posting for zwt6.  a variation from thenibble.com  and after making myself i 
  did reduce the butter as kim127 suggested.  and after looking at momaphet's
  review and the original recipe i did reduce the sugar amount.    thank you
  both. also think the caramelized onion is a wonderful suggestion.
