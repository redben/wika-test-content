  Tried and true. i used to make this all the time and recently i realized i
  hadn't made it in a while, so i decided to make it.  my daughter ooo'd and
  aww'd and asked what was wrong with me because i hadn't made it in so long. 
  she claimed it was her favorite dish i've made.  it is essential to shred the
  meat as the liquid will absorb into the crevices of the shreds, otherwise
  leaving it in chunks will be more runny. to save time, i've normally completed
  the cooking of the meat the day before and i finish it off the next day. 
  voila, it's done. i think i found this recipe in good housekeeping magazine,
  but i can't quite recall.  i have changed it through the years, adding my own
  tweaks.
