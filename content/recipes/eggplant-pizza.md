  In a pathetic attempt to make eggplant parmigiana, i created this instead.
  it's very easy and uses basic ingredients that are probably already in your
  kitchen. i've made it about a dozen times in the past few months and my
  husband loves it. it's a very flexible recipe and i've tried it a few
  different ways already and it always tastes great and surprisingly like pizza.
  goes well with any pasta dish or risotto.
