description: "Jennifer martin of portland, oregon, writes: \"i am not formally trained in cooking but grew up working in food service, from chopping vegetables at food festivals to catering parties for a little extra income. today i own epicure custom cooking, a gourmet takeout shop and catering company with a few tables for dining. our specials change weekly and are geared toward what i like to cook and eat. i simply love the business, even with my 12-hour days.\"\r\ncreamy but not heavy, this easy twist on pad thai is even better at room temperature after the flavors have blended. look for chili-garlic sauce and rice vinegar in the asian foods section of the supermarket. prep time does not include time to cool. taken from professional-cooking.com for zwt."
