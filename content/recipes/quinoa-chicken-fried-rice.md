 - Cook the quinoa first and let it stand and cool down
 - Its important to let the quinao sit in its water for at least an hour before you start cooking it so you get no bitter taste
 - In a saucepan big enough to hold all the quinoa fried rice , heat some oil and then stir fry the chicken until its mostly cooked
 - Add salt & pepper to taste
 - Add in the carrots , and sautee about a minute with the chicken to start softening the carrots up a bit
 - Add in the peas and corn and sautee with the chicken and carrots for about a minute
 - Scramble the eggs in a cup and then pour in with the chicken , carrots , peas , and corn
 - It is important to cook the scramble eggs before adding in the quinoa
 - If you pour the raw egg onto the quinoa , the quinoa will get soggy
 - When the eggs are scrambled , pour in the quinoa and the green onions along with the soy sauce
 - Mix all ingredients together well
 - Let cook in pan , stirring continually for about 1-2 minutes
