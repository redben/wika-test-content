description: >-
  This is a combination of altered, unrelated recipes that turned out
  wonderfully.  the creamy sage sauce is the real star, and could be used with
  other meat preparations such as roast pork, veal or why not turkey?  if you're
  a sage fan, this one's for you. prep time doesn't include brining.
