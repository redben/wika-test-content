 - Use frozen fruit if you can
 - I take spotty bananas , peel them , and put them in a large freezer bag so they're always frozen and ready !
 - Break bananas into chunks and put in good blender with rest of ingredients
 - You can add the chia to the blender , or add them after and let the smoothie sit about 15 minutes to "plump up" the seeds
 - You'll get a kind of "boba tea effect" and they will help keep you full and hydrated longer
 - I also added a small amount of parsley to mine since my herbs are already filming "herbs gone wild" in my garden
 - Adds a very fresh flavor , but don't add too much
 - Less is more with parsley until you're sure you like the flavor
 - Can use any kind of berries you'd like
