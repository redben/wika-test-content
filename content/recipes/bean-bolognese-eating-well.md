  This is from eatingwell.com. my family just about licked the bottom of the
  skillet after this is gone, which isn't common with meatless entrees. the
  original recipe calls for "salad beans", which i couldn't find, so i am
  posting great northern instead. i have made this with a can of mixed
  pinto/white beans, which was very yummy. the original recipe doesn't call for
  it, but i highly recommend adding a splash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce.
  it just takes the flavor up one more notch, imho. enjoy!
