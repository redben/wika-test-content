 - I have a blendtec blender that will grind up most anything--you can try this with a normal blender but the almonds and dates may not blend up as well
 - Make sure blender is dry and add flaxseeds and grind them up to a powder then add almonds and do the same
 - Add spinach , protein powder , and dates and then add water until you can see the water line 3 / 4 full in the container
 - Run through the whole juice cycle twice to make sure the dates are pureed
 - Each cycle is 45 seconds long
 - Pour the contents into 4-quart sized containersthey should each be about 2 / 3 full
 - Blend the bananas and pineapple with about a cup of water to keep things moving in the blender and add equally to the 4 containers
 - Blend up the blueberries with some water and mix into the quart containers
 - Ive also added , an avocado , strawberries , oranges or organic apples in place of the blueberries or if i dont have enough blueberriesjust to make enough to fill up the rest of the containers
 - This will keep for about 2-3 days in the fridge but freezes well if you need to store it longer
