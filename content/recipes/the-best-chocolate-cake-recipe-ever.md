title: The Best Chocolate Cake Recipe Ever
date: 2011-03-22T00:00:00.000Z
description: "Instead of frosting i use a glaze, petit fours icing, or i simply dust the cake with powdered sugar. this is similar to another recipe i found, but i wanted to know the nutritional value of the cake without the frosting, so i am publishing the recipe again. hopefully you will find it useful as well!\r\n\r\nalso, i only use fair trade certified cocoa, sugar, and coffee because of slavery in these industries, you can learn more about this from the not for sale campaign and the cnn freedom project."
