 - Bring the first three indgredients to a rapid boil in a large saucepan or dutch oven
 - Boil for 5 minutes , stirring constantly to prevent boiling over , sticking , and to help melt the candies
 - Reduce to a medium heat and place the apples into the hot syrup
 - Cook until done or about 15 minutes
 - They will fork tender -- don't overcook or you will have red applesauce ! cool and serve
 - We think they are best chilled overnight
