 - I find it easier to cut my chicken into small pieces if it is only partially-thawed , or i put it in the freezer for about an hour to firm it up , then cut
 - In a large skillet , heat 1 tblsp of oil over high heat until hot but not smoking
 - Brown chicken and transfer to a bowl
 - Heat remaining tblsp of oil until hot but not smoking and saute onions and mushrooms , stirring , for 2-3 minutes , or until golden
 - Add sherry and deglaze skillet , stirring and scraping up brown bits
 - Stir in broth , cream cheese , garlic , mustard and thyme
 - Season with salt and pepper to suit your taste
 - Boil gently for 3 minutes , whisking to incorporate cream cheese and mustard into sauce
 - Add chicken and any juices that have collected in bowl and cook 8-10 minutes longer
 - Taste and adjust seasoning
 - Arrange noodles or rice or mashed potatoes on a platter , spoon chicken and sauce over and sprinkle with parsley
 - Bon appetit !
