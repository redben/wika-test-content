  Need a drink that actually quenches your thirst?  this kind of reminds me of a
  lighter version of creamsicles.  if you added a little sorbet or ice cream
  that would really do the trick.  i used vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt
  and skipped the sugar.  this says it serves 1, but i really think it serves
  2.  recipe courtesy of best-smoothie-recipes.com.  yummy!
