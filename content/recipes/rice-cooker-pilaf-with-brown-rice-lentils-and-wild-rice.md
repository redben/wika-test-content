  This is a quick and easy pilaf with my favorite spice--cardamom! if you don't
  have cardamom on hand, you can omit it--the pilaf is still delicious without
  it. i improvised it one evening when i was short of canned chicken broth and
  time. i like the recipe because it combines two of my favorite rices with
  lentils. the lentils add protein. the dish is a perfect accompaniment to
  chicken baked with a generous sprinkling of cardamom.
