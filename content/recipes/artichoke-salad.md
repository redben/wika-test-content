  I have seen this recipe on my favorite channel (food network) and it looked so
  colorful with all the veggies , that i decided to make it in the same day for
  my parent in laws together with acharuli xachapuri (georgian cheese bread)
  that made a great combination. thank god, all went well and they loved both
  dishes:). i made some changes in the original recipe as always and it worked
  pretty well. the saltiness of capers and marinated peppers and artichokes is
  balanced with nice chunks of fresh mozzarella and little pieces of celery give
  crunch and great texture to the softness of those veggies. here it is my
  artichoke salad with  basil pesto dressing and  grilled chicken breasts.
