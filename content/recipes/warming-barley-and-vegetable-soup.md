  This is brilliant for weight watchers and is tasty even for those not watching
  their waistlines! the whole recipe, made as written, provides 15 points. i
  find it makes 6 bowls, so it's only 2.5 points per bowl. it's so filling that
  you won't be hungry until your next meal! it's worth including the parsnip in
  this recipe even though they can be hard to find as its flavour shines through
  in this dish. make this soup vegetarian by using vegetable stock rather than
  chicken stock.
