 - Preheat the oven to 200 degrees
 - Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper
 - Do not overlap
 - Place the tomatoes , cut side up , on the baking sheet
 - Season on the cut side with salt and pepper to taste , then drizzle with olive oil
 - Sprinkle 1 / 2 teaspoon cumin on each tomato half
 - Bake for 8 to 12 hours , or until the tomatoes have collapsed and shriveled to about 1 / 4 inch thick
 - They should still be moist inside
 - Cool completely , then refrigerate in an airtight container
 - Place a small skillet over medium heat
 - Add the seeds and toast , shaking the pan occasionally , for 2 to 4 minutes , until fragrant
 - Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cool completely
 - The low heat of the oven turns these tomatoes almost jammy , shriveling them and concentrating their flavor beautifully
 - The amount of time it takes depends greatly on the size and juiciness of the tomatoes , so for the least fuss , don't mix varieties or sizes
 - Left long enough , they'll start to get a little chewy around the edges , which makes a nice counterpoint to the moisture inside
 - Other herbs and spices , particularly cinnamon and paprika , can be substituted for the cumin , if desired
 - Put the tomatoes on bread or crostini for bruschetta , served as part of an an
 - The tomatoes can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks or frozen in heavy-duty plastic freezer bags for up to six months
 - If your refrigerator is under 38 degrees , you can pack the tomatoes into glass jars , covered with olive oil , for several months
