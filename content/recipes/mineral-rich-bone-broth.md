 - Preheat oven to 350 degrees
 - Place bones on pan and roast for one hour or till browned
 - Roasting gives rich flavor and debt of color
 - Place roasted bones , remaining ingredients and your optional ingredients in a 6 quart stock pot or crock pot cover with a gallon of filtered water
 - Heat the broth slowly and once the boil begins , reduce heat to its lowest point , so the broth just barely simmers
 - The first few hours of simmering , youll need to skim the impurities that float to the surface with a fine-mesh skimmer
 - Discard
 - I find that grass-fed and healthy animals does produce much less of scum as conventional animals
 - Do not allow the broth to come to a fast boil , and if more water is needed to keep the bones covered , add only hot water , not cold or lukewarm
 - The longer you cook the stock , the richer and more flavorful it will be
 - About 10 minutes before finishing the stock , add fresh herbs like parsley
 - This will impart additional mineral ions to the broth
 - Beef broth / stock: 48-72 hours
 - Poultry broth / stock: 24 hours
 - Fish broth: 8 hours
 - Remove from heat and let cool
 - Strain using a strainer to remove all the bits of bone and vegetable
 - When cool enough , store in a gallon size glass jar in the fridge for up to 5 days , freeze for later use or can in pressure canner for up to a year
 - Grass fed broth doesn`t need to have the fat removed that would be your choice
 - But i would removed the fat from grain fed broths
 - Just chill the strained broth and when fat comes to top it will harden then just remove with spoon
 - Fyi:you can add water and vinegar to the cooked bones and re-simmer for another 48-72 hours
 - ) the bones are very generous
 - So generous that you can reuse bones for at least six times
 - Once the bones disintegrate and gave it their all
 - Start with fresh bones
