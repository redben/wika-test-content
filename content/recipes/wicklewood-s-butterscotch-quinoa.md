title: Wicklewood S Butterscotch Quinoa
date: 2011-01-23T00:00:00.000Z
description: "Whether for breakfast or dessert, you can completely justify the butterscotch in this dish because of the protein packed quinoa. \r\ni always use dib's recipe for toasted quinoa #16399 it is perfect for this recipe as the nuttiness produced by toasting compliments perfectly the butterscotch flavour.\r\nupdate: i've tried to correct the fluid amount several times without success(editing glitches) but it is supposed to read; 150 ml water and 30ml milk."
