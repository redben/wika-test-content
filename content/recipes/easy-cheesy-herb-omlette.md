 - 1 combine all ingredients except for the pam and cheese and whisk with a fork
 - 2 preheat a small frying pan at medium low heat
 - Eggs cook and burn fast so use whatever setting you are most comfortable with you stove
 - Once hot spray a light coating of pam
 - 3 pour the egg mixture in the frying pan immediately after spraying with pam
 - Allow the eggs to cook for 2-3 minutes
 - Then tilt the frying pan and life one side of the omelet to allow the uncooked portion to pool under the cooked part
 - 4 after another minute or so cooking add the cheese to only half of the omelet
 - Once most of the cheese has melted fold one side of the omelet in half
 - 5 wait a bit then flip and let the other side cook ensuring all the egg has been thoroughly cooked
 - Serve with your favorite toast or bagel
 - Substitutions:
 - Instead of cream use milk
 - A little bit of dairy will fluff up those eggs while they cook
 - Instead of pam use butter or oil
 - Just be sure to completely cover the inside of the frying pan or your eggs will stick
 - No cheddar no problem
 - Any cheese will do
 - However the bolder the flavor of the cheese , the better your omelet will taste
 - Don't got dill
 - Crush some rosemary into the mix or even some mrs
 - Dash
