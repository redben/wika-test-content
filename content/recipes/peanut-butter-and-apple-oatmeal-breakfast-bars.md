description: >-
  I rarely cook anything for breakfast. a typical breakfast for me consists of a
  whole wheat bagel thin with peanut butter and honey, some days i top it with
  sliced bananas. on the side i generally have a glass of v8-fusion juice and a
  cup of tea. in the spirit of the healthy eats january challenge, i thought i'd
  whip up a healthy, easy and quick (only 20 minutes cook time) breakfast that
  can be enjoyed by the whole family. seeing as it is national oatmeal month, it
  seemed fitting that oatmeal be at the heart of today's breakfast. feel free to
  substitute another fruit instead of the apple or used dry ingredients. just
  make sure that your dried fruit isn't loaded with sugar or other artifical
  ingredients.
