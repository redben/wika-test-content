 - Heat oven to 400f
 - Combine sugar , oil , and garlic in a food processor , and pulse to grind the garlic
 - Add soy sauce , chili sauce , salt , and chicken
 - Process until the chicken is finely ground
 - Divide the chicken mixture into 20 equal parts , and form each into a small patty
 - Wet hands will make this less messy
 - Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat
 - Add half of the patties , and cook about 4 minutes , flipping the patties halfway through
 - They should be golden brown , but not cooked through
 - Place the patties on a sheet pan coated with cooking spray , and repeat with the remaining patties
 - Bake 5 to 10 minutes until cooked through
 - Use one spoon to scoop some mix , then use the second to slide the mix off the spoon into the pan
 - Pat the patty into the shape you want , then move on to the next one
