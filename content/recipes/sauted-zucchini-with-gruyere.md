description: >-
  Gruyere swiss cheese adds a wonderful nutty sophistication to this simple
  dish. gruyere is on the expensive side, but you don't end up needing as much
  because the flavor is more concentrated. you can substitute another swiss
  cheese if you like. the trick to keeping the zucchini from getting soggy and
  overcooked, is to saut√© it quickly in a rather hot pan.
