        <ul>
<li>First you will need a sauce pan that has a steamer basket</li>
<li>If your lobster tails are frozen thaw them out</li>
<li>Cut the top of the lobster tail enough to allow expansion of the meat</li>
<li>In the sauce pan - on a medium low heat mix together the garlic , butter and white wine stirring occasionally</li>
<li>Once the butter wine mix comes to a boil , place the steam basket and cover</li>
<li>Let the lobster tails steam for 8 minutes</li>
<li>They will turn bright red</li>
<li>Set aside</li>
<li>Using a strainer , pour the butter wine mixture into serving cups</li>
<li>Use the butter wine mixture to dip the lobster tails inches i hope you enjoy it !</li>
</ul>
