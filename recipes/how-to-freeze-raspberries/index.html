(yes, it is mine!) for $0.99&#x2F;pint.  those tiny little things are regularly $3.00 a pop.  i never buy them...somehow i can&#x27;t justify spending $3.00 for 3 handfuls of delicious, sweet, succulent raspberries.  (i had forgotten how tasty they are!)  but, for just $0.99...i&#x27;ll buy a pint.  or 12.  yep, 12.  what on earth are you going to do with 12 pints of raspberries that will start to go bad in 2 or 3 days???  eat them, bake with them, and freeze them.  of course.  first we (the kids and i) ate 2 pints.  for a snack.  we like them that much.  then, i froze 8 pints.  cause i knew that we&#x27;d eat them if i didn&#x27;t get them into the freezer.  right away!  i rinsed and let them drain for about 10 minutes.  then placed them on a paper towel to remove excess water.  then i neatly arranged them, gave into my type-a tendencies and placed them on a baking sheet.  popped them into the freezer for a few hours, then transferred frozen raspberries into freezer baggies.  i see mango raspberry smoothies in our future!  an antioxidant power punch of a smoothie!  mmmm...don&#x27;t you want to reach through the screen and munch on a few?  finally for breakfast saturday morning, i made a raspberry coffee cake, following this taste of home recipe but making a few delicious modifications along the way.  i almost made raspberry baked oatmeal, but ended up trying this new recipe!">
