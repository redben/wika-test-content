(taste fantastic though!)  i like this recipe like i used to like my mashed pototo: chunky.  but, when you are making this, because it&#x27;s not a potato - go a head and make this as sooth as you want - the nutritional quality of cauliflower and broccoli will not be ruined! oh, if you must (and please try to resist) add a little bit of rice&#x2F;soy&#x2F;fat-free milk. look at the nutrition lable for this recipe ===&gt;
please don&#x27;t ruin this by adding the following poisons: butter&#x2F;sour cream&#x2F;bacon&#x2F;cheese unless you&#x27;re going to add it s-p-a-r-i-n-g-l-y  i&#x27;d rather you use a garlic flavored olive oil instead.">
