<meta name="description" content="This is a recipe i came up with to use up leftover bbq pulled pork. it was such a hit with my boys that i thought i would post it. the recipe as written uses a loaf of rhodes bread dough as the pizza crust, but i&#x27;m sure you could use any crust of your choice, just follow the cooking instructions for that crust. i have tried this pizza on a pizza stone and on a cookie sheet, and the crust comes out crispier on a cookie sheet. note, the prep time assumes that your bread dough has already been thawed and is ready to use.">
