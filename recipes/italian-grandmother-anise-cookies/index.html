            <p>This is my grandmother's recipe, but since i didn't have a chance to know her i think of them as my mom's cookies. she uses 5 pounds of flour in her batch because she makes them once a year for the family reunion, so i whittled her recipe down into a 4 dozen batch. the amount of anise is up to you. if you think you didn't add enough anise to the cookies, you can add some to the icing. i like to leave some of them unfrosted since they're pretty darn good plain.</p>

        <ul>
<li>Combine the flour , sugar and heaping tablespoon of baking powder</li>
<li>In another bowl whisk together the eggs , vegetable oil and anise extract</li>
<li>Combine wet and dry ingredients</li>
<li>Dough will be sticky , add up to an extra 1 / 4 cup of flour if needed</li>
<li>Shape cookies as desired</li>
<li>One way to do it: roll about 2 tablespoons of dough between hands until you have a rope , fold rope in half and twist</li>
<li>You can also just make little dough patties</li>
<li>Place on ungreased cookie sheets</li>
<li>Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes</li>
<li>Remove from cookie sheets and let cool completely</li>
<li>To make icing , melt butter then add milk</li>
<li>Gradually mix in powdered sugar</li>
<li>Add more sugar or milk until at desired spreading consistency</li>
<li>Frost cookies</li>
<li>Icing will harden quickly so add non-pareils or other sprinkles immediately after frosting each cookie</li>
</ul>
