        <ul>
<li>Put all the dough making ingredients in your food processor with the dough paddle</li>
<li>You will get a soft and elastic dough</li>
<li>Set aside and let it rest until we prepare the potato stuffing</li>
<li>In the food processor put all the ingredients required for the potato stuffing and pulse it until it all mixes and comes together well</li>
<li>Potato should be minced</li>
<li>Divide dough 7-8 medium balls , dust the floor and roll the balls into small circle with the help of a rolling pin</li>
<li>Hold the rolled dough in your palm and place 2-3 tbsp of potato filling in the center</li>
<li>Use your judgement when it comes to filling , you should be able to close the dough with filling inside</li>
<li>Pinch the top of the dough to seal it well</li>
<li>Flatten the dough lightly with your hands and roll it out gently into 6-8 inch circle</li>
<li>Dont forget to sprinkle flour before rolling the dough</li>
<li>Cook the paratha on a tawa at medium-high heat</li>
<li>When one side is brown , flip the paratha and brush it with oil</li>
<li>Repeat the same process with other side too</li>
<li>Cook well on both sides till you see golden spots</li>
<li>Your paratha is ready</li>
<li>Top it with butter and serve hot with pickle or yogurt</li>
