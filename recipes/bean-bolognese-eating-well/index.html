            <p>This is from eatingwell.com. my family just about licked the bottom of the skillet after this is gone, which isn't common with meatless entrees. the original recipe calls for "salad beans", which i couldn't find, so i am posting great northern instead. i have made this with a can of mixed pinto/white beans, which was very yummy. the original recipe doesn't call for it, but i highly recommend adding a splash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce. it just takes the flavor up one more notch, imho. enjoy!</p>
