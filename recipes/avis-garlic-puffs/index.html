<meta name="description" content="My aunt avis loves to entertain in her beautiful home overlooking the atlantic ocean. she&#x27;s given me lots of great recipes that my own guests rave about. this easy, elegant and decadent finger food is one of my favorites. garlic puffs also make a great snack, a side dish for pasta and soups, or a rich replacement for croutons in a ceasar salad. 

stock up your freezer so you always have some on hand. they will store for several months in a zip locked freezer bag, but they probably won&#x27;t last that long! set up an assembly line with your egg dip and melted butter, and be ready to get your hands dirty. (these are worth it!)

some tips; be sure to use flavourful garlic butter in this recipe - that&#x27;s key to a tasty result. i usually add both fresh garlic and a pinch of garlic salt. don&#x27;t buy expensive parm - you can use the less expensive variety sold in plastic shakers.">
