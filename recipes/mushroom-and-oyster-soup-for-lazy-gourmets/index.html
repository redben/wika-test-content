            <p>A really quick fine-dining type recipe! the approximate american weights are given in brackets. you can assemble this soup a day ahead, and keep it in the fridge to heat gently just before serving. please adjust to your taste. use the best quality canned mushroom soup and smoked oysters -- it makes a big difference to the end result. it is rich, no excuses, but is served in very small portions -- not as generous as my photo seems to indicate!  ps: i think that 2 cans of oysters might be better than just one and will improve the flavour. if you find the cup of cream too much, use a 1/2 cup plus 1/2 cup chicken broth (or more mushroom soup).</p>
        </header>
        <ul>
<li>In a bowl , add all the ingredients except the pepper</li>
<li>About the smoked oysters: lift them from the tin with a fork when adding , and by all means use some of the canning oil too , as it adds to the flavour</li>
<li>If your oysters are quite large you can halve them</li>
<li>Whisk to mix</li>
<li>Please taste -- the soup is mild and rich , and you might want to add more lemon juice</li>
<li>I didn't measure , just squeezed a good squirt from half a lemon into the soup</li>
<li>At this stage the soup can be covered and kept in the fridge overnight , which will be better for flavour</li>
<li>To serve , heat very gently , or heat in a bowl in a warming oven</li>
<li>Do not boil</li>
<li>Serve as starter portions in small ramekins , with fresh rye bread alongside</li>
</ul>
