when i was a young man, i worked at a theater.  one of the main differences in the way that theaters pop their corn is the addition of finely ground salt into the pot while it is popping. well, that and that the oil is tinted yellow with coloring.  you can add as little or as much salt as you like, these are just my preferences.  this recipe is done on the cooktop.">

            <p>Taking reviewers suggestions, i've modified the salt content to 1 teaspoon, thank you for the feedback.

when i was a young man, i worked at a theater.  one of the main differences in the way that theaters pop their corn is the addition of finely ground salt into the pot while it is popping. well, that and that the oil is tinted yellow with coloring.  you can add as little or as much salt as you like, these are just my preferences.  this recipe is done on the cooktop.</p>
        </header>
        <ul>
<li>Grind the kosher salt into a fine powder in a spice / coffee grinder</li>
<li>In a heavy pot , heat the oil over medium-high heat</li>
<li>Place one kernel of corn in the pot , when it pops you are ready to add the other ingredients</li>
<li>After the kernel pops , add the popcorn and the finely ground salt into the pot and cover</li>
<li>Give the pot a vigorous shake to distribute corn , oil and salt</li>
<li>Pop until complete , i usually pop until there is only one or two pops per second</li>
<li>Do not burn !</li>
<li>One taste and you'll see it's perfect &quot;movie theater popcorn&quot; !</li>
</ul>
