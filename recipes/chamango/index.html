<li>Set aside 1 / 2 cup mango</li>
<li>Place remaining mango in a blender jar with the ice and a bit of sugar if the mango is not very sweet</li>
<li>Process until it is smooth , but not so long that it melts</li>
<li>In a tall glass , place enough bits of mango to cover the bottom of the glass , then add a few teaspoons or more of chamoy , enough to make a distinctive red layer</li>
<li>Next , pour a few inches of mango ice , depending on how tall the glass is , to about halfway</li>
<li>On top of that , make another layer of diced mango , then more chamoy</li>
<li>Top with more mango ice , almost to the top of the glass</li>
<li>Add a final layer of chamoy</li>
<li>Add a few pieces of diced mango , then sprinkle some chunks of tamarind candy on top</li>
<li>Serve immediately with a fat straw and a spoon</li>
