<meta name="description" content="I have yet to find a roasted veggie that i didn&#x27;t like, so i am constantly playing with healthy, low calorie sauces and seasonings for them.  i came up with this last night to accompany linmarie&#x27;s recipe #45809 and sue lau&#x27;s recipe #38748.  i think it would be just as good with green beans (though the cooking time would need to be decreased slightly).  also, if you prefer a sweeter sauce, you could add a tablespoon of honey or brown sugar, as it is a fairly salty sauce as written.  if you want to reduce the fat and calories, you can omit the olive oil and simply spray the broccoli with cooking spray before roasting.

note: i love raw garlic flavor myself, but if 4 cloves seems like more raw garlic than you would like, trying stirring the garlic and ginger in with the broccoli before roasting as susie d brilliantly suggested!  :)">
