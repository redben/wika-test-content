            <p>My friend's mom comes to visit him each year from india and is a super cook. this is an amazing recipe which, once you have the ingredients in your spice collection and have done it once or twice, it is a breeze to make.  most of these ingredients can be stored for a long time.  buy them if possible from an indian grocery store because they are usually cheaper and fresher than a supermarket.  i have wowed many guests with this dish and it is time that this recipe goes into the public domain.</p>

        <ul>
<li>Ginger / garlic paste: in a blender add peeled ginger and peeled garlic in equal parts and a little water and blend into a paste</li>
<li>You can also buy this in the indian market , but it is much better when made fresh</li>
<li>Meat prep: cut chicken into bite sized pieces</li>
<li>In a bowl , mix chicken , salt , pepper , turmeric , cayenne , cumin powder and coriander powder</li>
<li>Set aside</li>
<li>Cooking: use medium heat ! lower heat and longer cooking time gives the best results</li>
<li>In a deep wide pan heat oil till it's hot and add cloves , cardamom and cinnamon stick</li>
<li>Move it it around for several minutes</li>
<li>At this point , i remove the clove and cardamom because i hate biting into them later</li>
<li>Add onions and saute until they are soft and golden</li>
<li>Take your time on this as this is what makes the gravy creamy ,</li>
<li>Add ginger / garlic paste and lower the heat to medium low and cook for several minutes scraping the bottom often</li>
<li>If you have enough oil in the pan you will not have that much of a problem</li>
<li>Hey ! it's indian food , so oil is necessary evil :)</li>
<li>Add chicken mix from the bowl and cook till the chicken turns color</li>
<li>Add butter if desired</li>
<li>Keep stirring so that bottom is not sticking</li>
<li>This will take about 8-10 minutes or so</li>
<li>Add tomato and cook for another 2 minutes</li>
<li>Then add hot water to the pan till it barely covers the chicken</li>
<li>Cook on medium high till you see a lot of bubbling</li>
<li>Lower the heat to medium / low and cover the pan and let it cook for about 25-30 minutes , stirring occasionally</li>
<li>When done , you should have smooth dark brownish gravy that is not runny and the chicken should be tender</li>
<li>Eat it with hot rice</li>
</ul>
