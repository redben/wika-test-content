        <ul>
<li>Place the flour on a dry , clean work surface , forming a mound about 8 to 10 inches in diameter at its base</li>
<li>Sprinkle the salt in the middle of the mound</li>
<li>Using the bottom of a measuring cup , create a well 4 to 5 inches wide , with at least 1 / 2 inch of flour on the bottom of the well</li>
<li>Slowly and carefully add the whole eggs , egg yolks and olive oil to the well , treating the flour as a bowl</li>
<li>Using a fork , gently beat the eggs without touching the flour walls or scraping through the bottom to the work surface</li>
<li>Then , still stirring , slowly begin to incorporate the flour walls into the egg mixture , gradually working your way toward the outer edges of the flour , but disturbing the base as little as possible</li>
<li>If the eggs breach the sides too soon , quickly scoop them back in and reform the wall</li>
<li>Once the dough starts to take on a thickened , paste-like quality , slowly incorporate the flour on the bottom into the mixture</li>
<li>When the slurry starts to move as a solid mass , remove as much as possible from the fork</li>
<li>Slide a pastry scraper or spatula under the mass of dough and flip it and turn it onto itself to clear any wet dough from the work surface</li>
<li>At this point , with your hands , start folding and forming the dough into a single mass</li>
<li>The goal is to incorporate all the flour into the mass , and using a spray bottle to liberally spritz the dough with water is essential</li>
<li>It is a very dry dough , and it is very important to generously and constantly spritz it with water to help glue any loose flour to the dry dough ball</li>
<li>When the dough forms a stiff , solid mass , scrape away any dried clumps of flour from the work surface , which , if incorporated in the dough , will create dry spots in the final product</li>
<li>To knead the dough , on your work surface , drive the heel of your dominant hand into the dough</li>
<li>Push down and release , and then use your other hand to pick up and rotate the dough on itself 45 degrees</li>
<li>Drive the heel of your hand back in the dough , rotate and repeat for 10 to 15 minutes</li>
<li>When the dough is ready , it will stop changing appearance and texture</li>
<li>The dough will be firm but bouncy to the touch and have a smooth , silky surface , almost like play-doh</li>
<li>Tightly wrap the dough in plastic wrap before proceeding as directed with your recipe</li>
<li>Makes about 20 oz</li>
<li>Of dough</li>
