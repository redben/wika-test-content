        <ul>
<li>Mix dry ingredients together in medium bowl</li>
<li>Add all wet ingredients to a separate bowl and stir just until blended</li>
<li>If you need to substitute for the buttermilk: in a liquid measure put 2 tbsp lemon juice and then fill the rest of the way to the 2c level with regular milk or milk substitute</li>
<li>Add the wet ingredient to the dry ingredients just until combined</li>
<li>Do not over mix , batter will be slightly lumpy</li>
<li>Lightly coat skillet with oil</li>
<li>Heat to medium low</li>
<li>Drop 1 / 4 cup of batter onto heated skillet</li>
<li>Use the back side of a spoon to help even out the batter</li>
<li>Cook on first side until bubbles begin to form on surface and underside is golden , about 2 minutes</li>
<li>Flip over and cook another 2 minutes until golden brown and center springs back when lightly touched</li>
<li>Serve warm with maple syrup and butter</li>
</ul>
