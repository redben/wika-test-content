<meta name="description" content="Since both of my kids are in college, most nights it is just dh and i for dinner, so i decided to buy the book &quot;small -batch baking&quot; by debby maugans nakos.  we love fresh baked bread, but find the recipes make too much for us, so this makes two mini loaves.  these are soft on the inside and with a crispy crust.  because these have no fat, they don&#x27;t save well, so best served same day of baking.
note:  this takes many hours of rising, not a good recipe for the weekdays if working, but great for a weekend or if you don&#x27;t work.  the long rising times really allow for the flavor development.  you will need to allow at least 5 hours rising time.">

<li>Place the balls of dough on an ungreased baking sheet</li>
<li>Sprinkle a little flour over each round , and cover them lightly with plastic wrap</li>
<li>Let the dough balls rise until nearly doubled in bulk , 1 to 1 1 / 2 hours</li>
<li>Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees f</li>
