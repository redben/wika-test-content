<meta name="description" content="This great dish i originally had in a small south carolina restaurant and absolutely fell in love it it. we had it for lunch one day and it was totally amazing. with a little help from the waiter, who also worked in the kitchen, he was able to give me a couple of parts i couldn&#x27;t figure out and after a couple of tries, i came up with what ... i think is pretty close. first off it certainly is not difficult even though it sounds like it, it is not quick cooking, that i admit, but it certainly isn&#x27;t expensive and again ... isn&#x27;t hard to do. a loaf layered with chicken, ham, mortadella, salami, artichokes and parmesan cheese. baked slow in a water bath and then chilled. sliced and served with a garlic herb aioli for a great lunch or light dinner. i have served this as a dinner course with a bowl of fresh soup to start, and then the terrine served over some fresh baby greens, and roasted vegetables which makes for a great light meal. if you want, this can also be sliced and then cut in half or quarters and served over some greens with the aioli for a light starter. i promise the guests will love it.">

            <p>This great dish i originally had in a small south carolina restaurant and absolutely fell in love it it. we had it for lunch one day and it was totally amazing. with a little help from the waiter, who also worked in the kitchen, he was able to give me a couple of parts i couldn't figure out and after a couple of tries, i came up with what ... i think is pretty close. first off it certainly is not difficult even though it sounds like it, it is not quick cooking, that i admit, but it certainly isn't expensive and again ... isn't hard to do. a loaf layered with chicken, ham, mortadella, salami, artichokes and parmesan cheese. baked slow in a water bath and then chilled. sliced and served with a garlic herb aioli for a great lunch or light dinner. i have served this as a dinner course with a bowl of fresh soup to start, and then the terrine served over some fresh baby greens, and roasted vegetables which makes for a great light meal. if you want, this can also be sliced and then cut in half or quarters and served over some greens with the aioli for a light starter. i promise the guests will love it.</p>

        <ul>
<li>Chicken -- first thing to do is to pound out the chicken</li>
<li>Place the chicken between plastic wrap and pound until thin</li>
<li>You can use a rolling pin , meat mallet or even the bottom of a heavy pan</li>
<li>Anything will work</li>
<li>The chicken will be used for two layers of the loaf so i try to cut the chicken in 2-3 smaller pieces so the chicken will fit to make the layers</li>
<li>Dipping station -- layout out your dipping station -- 1) well beaten eggs in one pie pan or small flat dish</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>parmesan , seasoned salt , pepper , cayenne , and lemon zest in the other</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pan -- line a loaf pan with parchment paper , bottom and sides and spray with non-stick spray</li>
<li>I use scissors and cut down the corners of the parchment paper to make it fit easier</li>
<li>Layer 1: chicken - dip 1 / 2 of the chicken in the egg and then in the parmesan mixture and place in the bottom of the loaf pan</li>
<li>Fit the pieces in well and tight so it covers the entire bottom of the pan</li>
<li>Layer 2: mortadella and proscuitto - top the chicken with the mortadella slices and then 1 / 2 of the proscuitto</li>
<li>Layer 3: artichokes - slice the artichokes in 1-3 pieces , depending on the size</li>
<li>Then dip 1 / 2 of the artichokes in the egg and then in the parmesan and place on top of the mortadella and proscuitto</li>
<li>Layer 4: fresh basil leaves -- all of the basil leaves</li>
<li>Layer 5: chicken again - same as above</li>
<li>Dip the remaining chicken in the egg and then parmesan and put on top of the artichokes</li>
<li>Layer 6: salami - top the chicken with all of the salami and then the remaining proscuitto</li>
<li>Layer 7: artichokes - last layer</li>
<li>Once again , dip in the egg and then parmesan and top the salami and proscuitto</li>
<li>All done -- cover with a piece of parchment paper and here is the key - it needs to be weighted down</li>
<li>Take a brick and cover it with aluminum foil</li>
<li>That really works best</li>
<li>Place on top of the parchment paper and now you are ready to bake</li>
<li>If you don't have a brick , just open a bag of beans and pour them on a sheet of foil and wrap up</li>
<li>Just something heavy to weigh the terrine down</li>
<li>Bake -- put the loaf pan in another pan , like a 13x9 , filled 1 / 2 way with warm water</li>
<li>Then bake at 350 for 1 1 / 2 hours on the middle shelf</li>
<li>The water will keep the terrine from getting too brown and let it cook slower</li>
<li>Remove and let cool completely , cover well with plastic wrap , and refrigerate overnight</li>
<li>Aioli -- mix all the ingredients together</li>
<li>Mayonnaise , lemon , herbs and garlic</li>
<li>Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve</li>
<li>This can be made ahead of time</li>
<li>Serve -- remove the plastic wrap and the top parchment paper from the terrine , then put a plate on top and flip over</li>
<li>Remove the parchment paper and then thin slice</li>
<li>You can serve this for a buffet too , it is so pretty to serve</li>
<li>I like to serve the slices over a bed a greens and top with the garlic herb aioli</li>
<li>Enjoy this great unique dish !</li>
