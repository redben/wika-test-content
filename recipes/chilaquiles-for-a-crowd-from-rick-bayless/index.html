  update; this was amazing!  just like i remembered! i made this today and used 1 jar of the salsa and 1 cup of chicken broth. i also bought a package of refrigerated corn tortillas. i cut into 9ths pizza style, and fried them in oil. i used 18 tortillas. i used a mexican queso fresco, a mexican crumbling fresh farmers type cheese for the garnish.  totally delish!  my scaled down verson would feed 4 to 6 as a main dish, or maybe 10 as a side.">
