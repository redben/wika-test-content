            <p>However you spell it, it's a rolled coffee cake made from a raised dough that has a walnut/chocolate swirl inside.  this recipe was given to me by both my aunt (in-law) and mother-in-law.  the family always enjoy it during every holiday/family gathering and since i've been successful at making it, that job seems to have been past on to me- the tradition shall continue.  yay!</p>

        <ul>
<li>Into a food processor , place flours , lemon rinds , 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar and butter</li>
<li>Process until mixture is crumbly</li>
<li>Set aside</li>
<li>In small bowl , warm milk to about 115f stir in remaining tablespoon of powdered sugar and package of yeast</li>
<li>Let sit until bubbly</li>
<li>Separate 4 eggs - beat yolks and refrigerate whites , to save for filling</li>
<li>Add yolks to the yeast mixture</li>
<li>In large bowl place flour / butter crumbles and pour eggs / yeast over top</li>
<li>Keeping it inside the bowl , mix and knead the dough one handed until smooth - important: dough will be very gooey and sticky- do not add more flour , just work the bumps out</li>
<li>Once dough is smooth - cover bowl tightly with plastic and refrigerate overnight</li>
<li>Now work on your filling:</li>
<li>Place walnuts , powdered sugar and cocoa into food processor</li>
<li>Chop until walnuts are finally grounded</li>
<li>Transfer to a bowl and let sit inside refrigerator until dough is ready</li>
<li>When dough is ready: heavily flour your work surface</li>
<li>Remove dough from bowl and roll out into a large rectangle</li>
<li>Once that is formed , remove egg whites and whip them in a bowl until stiff peaks form</li>
<li>Fold in the grounded nut mixture</li>
<li>Spread this filling over the dough rectangle and starting at one side , roll it up like a jelly roll</li>
<li>Seal the finishing edge with a bit of water</li>
<li>Now lift it carefully and place it into a well greased and floured bundt pan</li>
<li>Set pan in a cold oven to continue to rise for 2 1 / 2 hours or until dough is near the rim of the pan</li>
<li>Now bake at 325f for 1 hour and 15 minutes</li>
<li>If during that time the top begins to get too dark before it's ready , lay a piece of foil over the top</li>
<li>Allow it cool , then turn out carefully</li>
<li>Serve plain or sprinkle with powdered sugar</li>
<li>Refrigerate uneaten portions to maintain freshness</li>
<li>Slices are good cold or warmed in the microwave</li>
<li>Enjoy !</li>
