        <ul>
<li>Remove papery husk from garlic and peel each clove</li>
<li>Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil</li>
<li>Place peeled garlic in a single layer on the covered cookie sheet</li>
<li>Place in freezer for at least one hour</li>
<li>Remove cookie sheet with frozen individual cloves and place garlic cloves in a plastic zip top bag , now you can remove one or more cloves as your recipes directs</li>
<li>Garlic cloves do not become mushy and hold their shape well but are softer than fresh</li>
<li>I have used the frozen cloves in lots of ways from smashing them into a paste to slicing and chopping the cloves</li>
<li>The flavor stays nicely as well</li>
