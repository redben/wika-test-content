            <p>Homemade graham crackers are actually easy!  here is a recipe from fran costigan from the best cookbook ever: vegan chocolate. seriously, buy that book. the recipes and photos are all outstanding.  this recipe doesn't call for graham flour, because not everyone has that in the cupboard, but toasting flour first has the same effect. it also calls for regular sugar to be ground in a blender until it becomes powdered sugar. that's because purchased powdered suger has corn starch in it and changes the texture. but i think you could probably cheat. if you are making these for crumbs, it makes about 2 cups.</p>
