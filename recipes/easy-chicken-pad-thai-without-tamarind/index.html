        <ul>
<li>Place prepared chicken in a bowl and toss with 1</li>
<li>5 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>Set aside</li>
<li>Combine 'pad thai sauce' ingredients together in a cup , stirring well to dissolve sugar</li>
<li>Set aside</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of water to boil</li>
<li>Dunk in rice noodles and switch off heat</li>
<li>Allow noodles to soak approximately 6 minutes , or until soft enough to bend easily , but still firm and 'undercooked' by regular standards</li>
<li>Drain and rinse noodles briefly with cold water to keep from sticking</li>
<li>Set aside</li>
<li>Heat a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat</li>
<li>Drizzle in the oil and swirl around , then add the garlic , chili , galangal / ginger , and half of green onion , reserving remaining for later</li>
<li>Stir-fry 1 minute to release the fragrance</li>
<li>Add chicken and stir-fry 3-4 minutes , or until cooked</li>
<li>If pan becomes dry , add 1-2 tablespoons of the pad thai sauce , just enough to keep ingredients frying nicely</li>
<li>Push ingredients aside and crack egg into center of pan</li>
<li>Stir quickly to scramble , then combine with other ingredients</li>
<li>Add prepared noodles plus 3-4 tablespoons of the pad thai sauce</li>
<li>Using two utensils , lift and turn noodles to stir-fry and combine with other ingredients</li>
<li>Continue frying in this way , adding more of the sauce every minute or two , until all sauce has been added and the noodles are chewy-delicious and a little bit sticky</li>
<li>When sauce has been absorbed and noodles are cooked , fold in the bean sprouts</li>
<li>Remove from heat and taste-test , adding more fish sauce until desired taste is achieved</li>
<li>Portion out onto individual plates and add a lime wedge on the side</li>
<li>Before eating , top with remaining green onion and squeeze over the lime wedge , then finish with a generous sprinkling of chopped / ground nuts</li>
<li>For those whole like it extra spicy , serve with thai chili sauce on the side , and enjoy !</li>
<li>Traditionally , pad thai was made in just this way - without tamarind - and versions of this original formula can still be found in various regions of thailand</li>
<li>This particular recipe was taught to me by a local thai chef in south-western phuket , thailand</li>
<li>Use wheat-free soy sauce for gluten-free diets</li>
