source: food52. com &#x2F; brigidc&#x27;s. this is her description of the salad. 
sweet, salty, tart, crunchy and spicy, this salad has perfect flavor and texture balance. the inspiration was pomegranate molasses, which i learned about when i worked on a persian food class. i like how the molasses takes the acidic edge off the vinaigrette but it is still tangy and delicious.
be sure to try this no fuss, no muss recipe  recipe #446884
i made my own pomegranate molasses: recipe #490458 it&#x27;s easy and can be reduced to make a smaller amount.  it can be stored up to 6 months.">
