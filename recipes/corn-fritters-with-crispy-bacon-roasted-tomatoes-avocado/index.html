<meta name="description" content="Corn fritters for breakfast is a cherished event in our house. we both love this dish.... alot. i would go so far as to say this is my favourite breakfast of all time. and looking around the interwebs it looks like i&#x27;m not the only one.

when we lived in sydney we were frequent visitors to bill granger&#x27;s restaurants where this dish was one of the stars. in london i&#x27;ve been slowly perfecting it, doing my very best to faithfully recreate each element. i used the corn fritters with avocado salsa recipe in bills open kitchen as the base. however in his restaurant bill also serves his corn fritters &#x2F; avocado salsa with crispy grilled bacon, oven roasted tomatoes and fresh spinach. these elements really make the dish complete for me (but of course this a fantastic vegetarian dish sans bacon).

so here is my homage to bill granger and his wonderful corn fritters... with crispy bacon, oven roasted tomatoes, baby spinach and spicy avocado salsa.

        </header>
        <ul>
<li>Tomatoes&amp; bacon</li>
<li>Start with the tomatoes: preheat the oven to 180c cut each tomato in half lengthwise</li>
<li>Place on a roasting tray , cut side up</li>
<li>Drizzle with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper</li>
<li>Roast for 20-30 minutes</li>
<li>For the final 10 mins - move the tomatoes to bottom rack and turn the grill on</li>
<li>Lay out your rashers of bacon onto a grilling rack</li>
<li>Grill until crisp and crunchy turning regularly</li>
<li>Watch carefully to ensure bacon doesnt burn</li>
<li>Ideally bacon should be stiff and can practically be snapped like a biscuit</li>
<li>Remove both bacon and tomatoes and put aside</li>
<li>Turn oven down to 120c</li>
<li>Corn fritters</li>
<li>Place half of the corn kernels and the onion , eggs , coriander , flour , baking powder , salt and pepper in a food processor and process until combined</li>
<li>This is an important step ! whizzing the corn up in this way gives the binding agents a distinct corn flavour which i find lacking in other fritters which do not do this</li>
<li>I believe this is one of the secrets that make bill's fritters so damn good ! place in a large bowl , add the remaining corn and stir to combine</li>
<li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium to high heat</li>
<li>When the oil is hot , drop 2 heaped tablespoons of mixture per sweetcorn cake into the pan and cook in batches of three for 1 minute each side</li>
<li>Drain on paper towels and keep warm in the oven while you are making the rest of the cakes</li>
<li>Serve with the avocado salsa</li>
<li>Avocado salsa</li>
<li>Place all the ingredients in a bowl and stir very gently to combine</li>
<li>Season well</li>
<li>To serve</li>
<li>Create stacks of the various elements in any combination you wish</li>
<li>Place a fritter on the plate , then any combination of bacon , spinach , tomatoes and other fritters that your heart desires</li>
<li>Top with avocado salsa and drizzle with olive oil</li>
<li>Yum !</li>
</ul>
