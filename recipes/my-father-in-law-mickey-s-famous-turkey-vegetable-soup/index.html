feel free to change up anything to your own taste or make this soup as is!! either way, it&#x27;s delicious!!!">

        <ul>
<li>In a large soup pot , brown the ground turkey in a little bit of olive oil so it doesn't stick and break it up into small pieces</li>
<li>Add diced onion , cook until it starts to soften a bit</li>
<li>Add in desired amount of broth</li>
<li>Next , add your vegetables</li>
<li>If using potatoes , i recommend adding them in last , after the celery and carrot start to soften a bit</li>
<li>Then add to taste , your herbs and seasonings</li>
<li>Cook until all the vegetables are tender</li>
<li>May cook covered or uncovered</li>
<li>If uncovered , it will reduce a bit and the flavors will intensify more</li>
<li>Serve over warm cooked rice or orzo , a sprinkle or two of parmesan cheese and a dash of hot sauce and enjoy !</li>
</ul>
