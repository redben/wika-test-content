        <ul>
<li>Start cooking the pasta shells in 3 quarts of boiling water to which a few drops of salad oil and a little salt were added</li>
<li>Stir occasionally</li>
<li>Cook eleven minutes for well done , drain , don't rinse , set aside</li>
<li>Next i browned the onions in some margarine and scraped into small dish to set aside until the meat is browned</li>
<li>Turned up the heat and put in the ground beef , started breaking it up with spatula</li>
<li>Continued to brown the beef and break up with a little cookie-cutter type chopper with sharp , scalloped teeth (use whatever you prefer as a utensil</li>
<li>Brown to me is parts are actually a nice brown , not just stirring around until all the pink is gone</li>
<li>It helps with the flavor</li>
<li>When beef was browned to my satisfaction , put the onions back into the skillet with the browned , broken-up beef</li>
<li>Added the tomato paste , diced tomatoes and water , stirred on low heat</li>
<li>Add the flavor booster and did a taste test because it's salty , just right</li>
<li>To avoid over salting , i didn't use any salt except what i boiled the shells in until i added the booster</li>
<li>Add the seasoned salt , seasoned pepper blend , parsley , worcestershire sauce and cheese</li>
<li>If it's too thick , add a little more water</li>
<li>If too watery , cook it down while stirring , doesn't take long</li>
<li>Can be eaten right away , baked in oven , frozen , or made a day ahead</li>
<li>Add ground pepper to taste when served</li>
</ul>
