        <ul>
<li>Preparation:</li>
<li>Cook the bacon ahead of time</li>
<li>Fry until crispy , and create little bacon bits to suit your preferred size and texture for the topping</li>
<li>Filling:</li>
<li>Cook the simply potatoes traditional mashed potatoes according to the directions on the package</li>
<li>Once heated and ready to eat , you must add the other filling ingredients to the mashed potatoes</li>
<li>The cream and butter add just that extra traditional flavor and keep the potatoes very moist</li>
<li>Mix all the filling ingredients together</li>
<li>Spring rolls:</li>
<li>I like use fresh spring roll wrappers about 4 inches wide x 6 inches long , however it is up to you how big or small you want your rolls to be</li>
<li>Add about 1 1 / 2 tablespoons of the mashed potato mix to each spring roll</li>
<li>Roll the spring roll</li>
<li>Secure the ends by adding a bit of water to one end and firmly pressing down onto the other end</li>
<li>Repeat until you have either no more mashed potato mix , or no more spring roll wrappers</li>
<li>Cook:</li>
<li>I prefer to use a deep pan</li>
<li>Add enough olive oil to fill 4 inches of the bottom of the pan</li>
<li>Heat olive oil until it starts to bubble</li>
<li>Add a few spring rolls at a time to the oil , cook for about 1 minute on each side</li>
<li>The trick is , you want the wrapper to stay somewhat soft and easy to bite into</li>
<li>Frying for more than a minute or two will make the wraps too crunchy</li>
<li>Drain the rolls by placing them onto paper towels</li>
<li>Assemble fully loaded rolled mashed potatoes:</li>
<li>Place the potato rolls on a serving plate</li>
<li>Here is where you can get fancy</li>
<li>Garnish with sour cream , green onion , cooked bacon , sundried tomatoes , and shredded goat cheese</li>
<li>I promise , you will love it ! enjoy !</li>
