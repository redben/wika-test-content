        <ul>
<li>Prepare jars and lids by boiling in water for about 10 minutes</li>
<li>Using the red part of the watermelon , remove the seeds and cube</li>
<li>Place in a blender or food processor and blend well</li>
<li>The four cups of cubed watermelon should yield 2 cups of juice / puree , add or remove juice to equal 2 cups</li>
<li>At this point the juice can be strained , i don't strain my juice</li>
<li>Juice lemons to get 3 tablespoons , fresh squeezed is best</li>
<li>Bottled is not as good tasting but will work</li>
<li>Add the zest of one lemon to the lemon juice , the amount of zest is approximate for a lemon , set aside</li>
<li>The zest can be optional , so don't worry about it if you are using bottled lemon juice</li>
<li>In a separate container mix 1 / 2 cup of white granulated sugar with the package of dry no sugar pectin , i use 100% natural sure jell premium fruit pectin</li>
<li>Open another box , measure and add 1 tablespoon additional , mix sugar and pectin well , set aside</li>
<li>Measure out the other 3 cups of sugar in a separate container , and set it aside , close to the cooking area</li>
<li>Pour the 2 cups of watermelon juice / puree into a large stainless steel pot</li>
<li>Add 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and zest to the watermelon juice</li>
<li>Stir in the sugar pectin mixture and bring to a hard boil</li>
<li>The heat will be on medium high to high at this point</li>
<li>I like to use a whisk to constantly stir the mixture until it boils</li>
<li>Reaching the boiling stage should take between 5-10 minutes , keep stirring</li>
<li>Add the remaining 3 cups of sugar and bring back to a hard boil , stirring or whisking constantly for about 1-2 minutes</li>
<li>Remove from heat</li>
<li>Fill prepared jars about 1 / 4 inch from the top</li>
<li>Wipe the rim of jars and place lids and rings to the jars</li>
<li>Seal in prepared jars , approximately 1 / 2 pint jars , 1 / 4 pint jars , or pint jars</li>
<li>Place filled jars in a boiling hot water bath with about 1 inch of water covering the top of the jars</li>
<li>If you do not have a canner use a large stock pot with a towel in the bottom</li>
<li>Do not let the jars touch</li>
<li>Boil gently for about 10 minutes</li>
<li>Remove jars and set away from draft to cool</li>
<li>I place towel lined cookie sheet in the cold oven and let the jars cool in the oven with the door closed</li>
<li>Make sure that the jars have sealed before storing</li>
<li>The jelly is good for about 12 months , but is best the first 6 months</li>
<li>The color and consistency may change the longer it is stored</li>
<li>Use as you would with any other jelly , this is a great icing for a yellow cake</li>
<li>Optional: if you are making several batches and you want them a little different , add whole spices</li>
</ul>
