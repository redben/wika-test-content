        <ul>
<li>Equipment: 8-inch round springform cake tin</li>
<li>Start with the icing , though first preheat the oven to 180c / 350f / gas mark 4 and pop in a baking sheet at the same time</li>
<li>Put all of the icing ingredients except the chopped chocolate into a heavy-based saucepan and bring to the boil , making sure everythings dissolved</li>
<li>Then turn off the heat but leave the pan on the hob then quickly add the finely chopped chocolate and swirl the pan so that it is all underwater , so to speak</li>
<li>Leave for a scant minute , then whisk until you have a darkly glossy icing , and leave to cool</li>
<li>I find this takes exactly the amount of time the cake takes to make , cook and cool</li>
<li>But do give the icing a stir with a spatula every now and again</li>
<li>Line the bottom of your springform cake tin with baking parchment</li>
<li>Put the flour , bicarb , salt and instant espresso and unsweetened cocoa in a bowl and fork to mix</li>
<li>Mix together the sugar , water , coconut oil and vinegar until the coconut oil has melted , and stir into the dry ingredients , then pour into the prepared tin and bake for 35 minutes</li>
<li>Though do check at the 30-minute mark to see if it is already done</li>
<li>When it's ready , the cake will be coming away from the edges of the tin and a cake tester will come out clean , apart from a few crumbs</li>
<li>This is a fudgy cake and you don't want to overdo it</li>
<li>Once the cake is cooked , transfer the tin to a wire rack and let the cake cool in its tin</li>
<li>Turn to your icing , and give it a good stir with a spatula to check it is at the right consistency</li>
<li>It needs to be runny enough to cover the cake , but thick enough to stay on the top</li>
<li>So pour over the unmoulded cake , and use a spatula to ease the icing to the edges , if needed</li>
<li>If you wish to decorate , now is the time to do it</li>
<li>In which case , sprinkle joyously with rose petals and chopped pistachios or anything else that your heart desires</li>
<li>Otherwise , leave it gleaming darkly and , indeed , sumptuously</li>
<li>Leave to stand for 30 minutes for the icing to set before slicing into the cake</li>
<li>Freeze</li>
<li>When cool , carefully wrap cake in a double layer of clingfilm and a layer of foil</li>
<li>Freeze for up to 3 months</li>
<li>To defrost , unwrap and place on a serving plate at room temperature for 34 hours</li>
