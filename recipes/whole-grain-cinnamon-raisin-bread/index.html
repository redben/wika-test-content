            <p>This bread is bee-yew-tiful toasted and even better as cinnamon toast, but you won’t believe how amazingly delicious it is for grilled cheese sandwiches!   it's soft and tender, moist and flexible enough to fold without cracking or tearing. it is the texture of your husband’s and children’s white bread dreams. that’s how i finally got mine to eat true whole wheat bread (but i still have to leave out the nuts, grains, and seeds from theirs). it’s the lecithin. i have never been able to achieve this texture without it. so, while it is not necessary to the successful taste or rising of the bread, it is definitely necessary for this specific texture and softness.</p>
