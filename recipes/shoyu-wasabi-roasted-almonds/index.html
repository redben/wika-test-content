<meta name="description" content="Tried to find recipes to use up this huge bag of wasabi powder i bought from an asian market. the 1 kilo bag was priced about the same as two of those little 1oz cans so.... i have a lot of wasabi powder.  we had a couple pounds of almonds left over from the holiday cookie baking frenzy too and i don&#x27;t like to let them get rancid so.... of course, wasabi almonds. i looked for recipes and thought right away that most of them would present the same problem that every other spiced nut recipe would. the spices won&#x27;t adhere to the nuts. you&#x27;re left with slightly seasoned nuts and a pile of spices in the bottom of the bowl. i tried the recipe going around with egg whites (baking wasabi pretty much renders the flavor out), i didn&#x27;t want sugary sweet, and oily nuts were givng me the spice piles in the bowl. i&#x27;ve eaten the blue diamond wasabi almonds before and thought they were okay so i checked their wasabi almond ingredients on their website. this is what i came up with that works for me.">

        <ul>
<li>Line a baking sheet with non-stick aluminum foil or parchment paper</li>
<li>Pre-heat oven to 350</li>
<li>Spread almonds on the sheet to a single layer</li>
<li>Bake for 10 minutes</li>
<li>While the nuts are baking , combine marinade ingredients in a stainless mixing bowl large enough to accomodate all the nuts and whisk to combine</li>
<li>After the almonds have baked for the 10 minutes pour them into the marinade and stir to evenly coat them and then put them back on the sheet in a single layer and bake for an additonal 10 to 15 minutes stirring the nuts at about 7 minutes or so so that they will bake evenly</li>
<li>Taste one at ten minutes and see if is roasted to your liking if not continue until they are done</li>
<li>Rinse and dry your mixing bowl and combine the dry ingredients in it</li>
<li>When the nuts are done roasting , toss them while they are still hot in the dry ingredients</li>
<li>Drop the nuts into a wired strainer over a plate and shake the excess powder off</li>
<li>Warning ! done this way the nuts are a wasabi bomb so if you like it milder , use less powder and a lighter coating</li>
