<meta name="description" content="I found this recipe on one of my low carb diabetic recipe sites. we loved it and i could eat it because it was so low in carbs which wasn&#x27;t hard on my blood surgar levels. plus, it tasted really good.  i ate it over 1&#x2F;4 c of cooked rice which had 36 g of carbs and the chicken dish has only 9.5 g carbs. so, it gave me only 45 g of carbs for my dinner. i had been trying to keep it to 45g carbs per meal so i loved this one! the 28 minute cooking time is for the chicken dish only. there is another 20 minutes to cook the rice.  that makes it 48 minutes for cooking time.">
