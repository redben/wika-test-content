            <p>Another recipe i am posting for india that is from "the bbq bible" by steven raichlen.  here is what he states:  "the procedure is simple enough. when you order naan, the baker takes a soft white ball of dough and rolls it into a flat bread. a few slaps from hand to hand stretch the bread into its traditional teardrop shape. using a pillowlike holder called a gaddi (literally "throne"), the baker presses the bread onto the walls of a hot tandoor. the gaddi protects his hand-a must when you consider that the temperature of the tandoor can reach 700°f. the bread emerges from the oven puffed and blistered on top and crisp and brown on the bottom. it’s sweet and smoky, pliable and moist, and about as delicious as bread gets.  note:  allow 2 hours for rising.</p>
