            <p>This dish has a turkish name and i guess it's origin is turkey. however the recipe i am sharing today comes from the southern part of bulgaria. it is very healthy meal, full with vitamins and protein. it is usually made with pork or beef, tomatoes,okra, mushrooms, peas, green beans, potatoes, eggplant, onions, herbs, and spices and is often served with "balkan mixed salad", a combination of roasted eggplant, sweet roasted peppers, garlic, tomatoes.
the veggies in this dish can vary depending on the season.  here is my version of it. you will need a  large clay bowl with lid.</p>
        </header>
        <ul>
<li>Mix the first 10 ingredients in a large clay bowl</li>
<li>With lid</li>

<li>Mix all together in the clay bowl , cover and cook in a non preheated oven at 550 f for 1 hour</li>
<li>Turn down the temperature to 350 and continue cooking for another hour</li>
<li>This dish would serve 10 large portions</li>
