<meta name="description" content="This recipe is from autralian good food june 2010 easy one-pot family meals bonus book. my dad made this for me and the chicken was so tender and tasty. the sauce is delicious and hearty with its italian flavours, it makes a great winter meal. i would not recommend leaving out the anchovies if you don&#x27;t like them. i don&#x27;t like them, but i didn&#x27;t know they were in there until dad told me! i think they are important to the flavour of the sauce, as are the capers and rosemary. if you don&#x27;t have fresh rosemary, dried works just fine. you could also use chicken breast instead of thigh fillets, i don&#x27;t usually like thigh fillets, but in this dish i thought they were delicious, very tender and almost falling apart. you would probably not get quite the same result with breast. if you do use breast you will have to reduce the cooking time. also, make sure you use a pan with a lid, because it needs to be covered during part of the cooking process. it is great served with salad greens and crusty bread.">
