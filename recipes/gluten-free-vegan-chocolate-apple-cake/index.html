<meta name="description" content="This is a bit of a work in progress. i made this cake up because i had apples to use up and was craving something chocolate-y. it&#x27;s quickly made with ingredients which i usually have on hand, and it tastes pretty good, but it&#x27;s not five-star-terrific yet. so if you choose to try it and come up with suggestions to improve it, i&#x27;d be very grateful!
i used erythritol in place of sugar, but of course you can use sugar or xylitol. i think half brown sugar or evaporated cane juice would be very good, too.
with 2&#x2F;3 cup sugar it&#x27;s probably not very sweet, so if you&#x27;re sweet toothed, use 3&#x2F;4 cup of sugar or other sweetener.
don&#x27;t overbake it or it will get dry. i found that the toothpick should not come out completely clean. the cake is ready when it feels soft and springy pressing the top slightly, 35 minutes in my oven.">

            <p>This is a bit of a work in progress. i made this cake up because i had apples to use up and was craving something chocolate-y. it's quickly made with ingredients which i usually have on hand, and it tastes pretty good, but it's not five-star-terrific yet. so if you choose to try it and come up with suggestions to improve it, i'd be very grateful!
i used erythritol in place of sugar, but of course you can use sugar or xylitol. i think half brown sugar or evaporated cane juice would be very good, too.
with 2/3 cup sugar it's probably not very sweet, so if you're sweet toothed, use 3/4 cup of sugar or other sweetener.
