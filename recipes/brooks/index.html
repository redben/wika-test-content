            <p>My grandmother's dear friend indabelle passed this recipe on to our family. these were a big hit with everyone, and we all enjoyed getting in the kitchen to help make them. even when we were little we could help pinch the roll mix shut, and nothing was more fun than slicing a hot brook open and slipping in a slice of cheese to melt. my grandma always made lots of extras and froze them. they are easy to pop in the microwave for a good comfort food snack, and you don't have to eat the hot roll part, so you can save yourself the carbs by discarding it once it's done its job melting your cheese!</p>

        <ul>
<li>Preheat oven to 375</li>
<li>Make hot roll dough according to directions on the box and allow to rise once</li>
<li>Brown beef over medium heat with chili powder , drain</li>
<li>You could try this mixing in sausage or venison , too</li>
<li>While beef browns , cook cabbage and onion in a little water with salt and pepper , then drain</li>
<li>Mix beef and cabbage mixture together in a large bowl</li>
<li>Roll dough out thin and cut into squares that are about 8&quot; on each side</li>
<li>Spoon two heaping tablespoons of the beef / cabbage mixture in the center of the square , then fold the corners in to meet at a point at the top of the brook</li>
<li>It will look like a &quot;x</li>
<li>&quot;</li>
<li>Place the brooks , &quot;x&quot; side down , on a greased cookie sheet</li>
<li>Bake until dough browns</li>
<li>Plate , then slit the top to slide in your slice of cheese</li>
<li>Grandma always served this with potato chips and dill pickles</li>
<li>Bet you can't each just one !</li>
