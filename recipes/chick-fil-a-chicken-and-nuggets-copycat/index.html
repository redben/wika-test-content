<meta name="description" content="After looking on the internet for days for a chick-fil-a copycat and finding only plain old fried chicken recipes, i decided to try and imitate it myself. it came out pretty darn close i think! there are two crucial ingredients chick-fil-a uses that most recipes dont have- pickle juice and sugar. they also use msg- but its also ok without it if you dont like it. just cut up the breasts into chunks and follow recipe for nuggets. (edit: i also have to say i love chick- fil-a and that i think they&#x27;re a great company. i encourage anyone to visit if they can, the staff is always so nice and polite at every location i&#x27;ve been to! its just too bad they don&#x27;t have more locations!)">

<li>Pound chicken breasts till they are thin enough for your taste</li>
<li>Cut into chunks if you want nuggets</li>
<li>Place chicken in plastic bag with pickle juice and marinate for an hour</li>
<li>Mix up eggs in seperate bowl for the egg wash</li>
<li>Mix flour and remaining spices in another shallow bowl</li>
<li>Remove chicken from the pickle juice maranade and drain well</li>
<li>Dip into the egg wash and then into the flour mixture</li>
