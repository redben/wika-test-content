        <ul>
<li>Shrimp marinade -- in a large baggie , add the oil , apricot preserves , dijon mustard , curry powder , and garlic and let marinade 1-2 hours</li>
<li>No longer</li>
<li>Thirty minutes to me is the minimum for great flavor</li>
<li>Rice -- my son likes rice with this dish , so that is an option , i enjoy the shrimp right over the salad</li>
<li>But if you want rice</li>
<li>Now is the time to make it</li>
<li>The shrimp and salad both take very little time to make</li>
<li>Salad -- prepare your salad</li>
<li>Add the cabbage to a large bowl along with the scallions , water chestnuts , zucchini , and onions</li>
<li>Crunch -- in a small non-stick skillet , add 1 teaspoon butter and bring to medium / medium high heat</li>
<li>Add the almonds and ramen noodles and cook until golden brown , 1-2 minutes</li>
<li>Remove to a small plate lined with a paper towel to let cool a few minutes</li>
<li>Shrimp -- the shrimp is marinated and ready to grill</li>
<li>Use whatever method you like</li>
<li>I have grilled them both inside and also outside using my vegetable basket and they both work great</li>
<li>You can broil too</li>
<li>Salt and pepper well and then grill on medium high heat until the shrimp begin to curl and turn pink</li>
<li>Don't over cook , they will only take a couple of minutes per side</li>
<li>Two minutes , flip two more and they will be done , remove and cover with foil</li>
<li>Extra large or jumbo may take a few more minutes , but not much</li>
<li>As the shrimp cooks , make the dressing</li>
<li>Dressing -- in that same pan as you cooked those noodles and almonds in , add the oil , sugar , apricot preserves , vinegar and bring to a boil for just a minute no more</li>
<li>Remove from the heat and slowly add the soy sauce</li>
<li>Finish -- add most of the dressing to the salad and toss well</li>
<li>Depending on the size of the cabbage and how much dressing you like , you may not use it all</li>
<li>You can easily save it for another night</li>
<li>Then add in the cooled almonds and ramen noodle mixture and toss again</li>
<li>Top the warm salad with the shrimp and serve on a platter family style</li>
<li>Option , as i said my son likes rice too with this and you can serve this right along the side which makes a great dinner</li>
