<meta name="description" content="Ready, set, cook! hidden valley contest entry. i love to make panini sandwiches for my family. the kids especially like this one because of the crunchy ranch topping on the outside. it make it very special. in fact it was so good they didn&#x27;t seem to notice i slipped a  &quot;green&quot; veggie (spinach) in there. i am always careful when cooking the panini, however, because if the heat is too high it will burn. i also love to use my panini maker that i got for christmas but it doesn&#x27;t get as much of a crunch as a regular pan does.">
