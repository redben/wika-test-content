            <p>This is more of a technique than a recipe, as we all probably know how to make these separately, but the groove is in how to get them all to the plate hot at the same time. required is a pan and a spatula, a microwave, and a toaster. you think you can't have breakfast on the fly? i'll have you eating in about 5 minutes. promise.</p>

        <ul>
<li>Prep: the first thing i do is get the eggs out of the fridge , the bacon and the bread</li>
<li>I try to get the eggs to room temp by putting them out early , but it isn't required</li>
<li>They may just take a bit longer to cook</li>
<li>Get your pan on the burner and pre-heat it to medium-ish</li>
<li>I start closer to medium low , then move it to medium when i'm there cooking the eggs</li>
<li>Now , the bacon</li>
<li>Ever used a microwave for your bacon ? it's too easy , trust me</li>
<li>Take 2-3 slices and place them evenly on a paper towel</li>
<li>Cover with another piece of towel and get them on a microwave safe plate</li>
<li>Times may vary for this , but my oven is 1000 watts and the bacon gets nice and crispy how i like it in two minutes , thirty seconds</li>
<li>Adjust according to yours</li>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Just place two slices in the toaster ready to go</li>
<li>Cooking: you've got your eggs next to the stove and your pan on and heated , your bacon is in the microwave , and the bread is standing by in the toaster</li>
<li>Set the microwave to 2:30 and hit start , press down the plunger on the toaster , put some butter in the pan to melt , and break the eggs into the pan</li>
<li>Don't worry about the toast or bacon getting done early , as they will keep warm from residual heat in their respective cooking implements</li>
<li>We're going to concentrate on the eggs</li>
<li>You've cracked them in there and they're beginning to turn white</li>
<li>At this point , i salt them and crack some liberal pepper over them</li>
<li>To taste , of course</li>
<li>Next , you'll see a sort of raised ring , about a half inch to inch around the yolk , of white</li>
<li>I constantly take the corner of my spatula and break through this to the cooking surface</li>
<li>What that does is expose more and more white to the heat and i like this part cooked and not runny , but the yolk really runny</li>
<li>Once this has set up , you're basically done</li>
<li>Shake the pan and look to see if you have any jiggly , clear bits</li>
<li>No ? put the eggs on a plate</li>
<li>Careful getting the bacon out of the microwave and towels</li>
<li>Hot</li>
<li>Put them on the plate as well</li>
<li>Butter the toast , put them on the plate</li>
<li>Sit down and feast like a king , or queen , heheheh</li>
<li>I like to break the yolks , cut up the the eggs and mix it all together , and pile a fork full on a corner of the toast and chow down like that , occasionally taking a bite of the savory bacon for a change of tongue scenery , if you will , but you eat it however you like , heheh</li>
