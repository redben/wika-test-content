they were such a hit at home that i asked her for the recipe. which she very graciously provided.
now it is my job to bake a batch every year for our family reunion christmas celebration.
these cookies are truly so scrumptious that there are never any leftover. 
(i use a cookie scoop, like an ice cream scoop, dipped in cold water before each use. individual cookie dough flash freezes very well. cook time is for one sheet in the oven - the rest of the dough is in the freezer!)">
