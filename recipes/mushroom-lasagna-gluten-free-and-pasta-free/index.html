<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
<li>Saute mushrooms in margarine and olive oil in a large skillet until lightly browned and moisture is released from the mushrooms</li>
<li>Place half of the cooked mushrooms in the bottom of an 8 x 8 casserole dish and spread out evenly</li>
<li>Sprinkle with 1 / 4 cup mozzarella</li>
<li>Place in oven for 5-10 min</li>
<li>, just long enough to slightly melt the cheese</li>

<li>Place remaining mushrooms on top of ricotta layer , and cover with 3 / 4 cup sauce</li>
<li>Top with 3 / 4 cup mozzarella and 1 / 4 cup italian cheese blend</li>
<li>Cover with foil , making sure the foil is tight enough so that it's not touching the cheese</li>
<li>Bake for 45 minutes , then remove foil</li>
<li>Return to oven for 10-15 minutes , or until cheese is bubbly</li>
<li>Heat remaining pasta sauce to serve with the meal</li>
<li>Allow lasagna to stand for at least 10 minutes before cutting</li>
