            <p>I don't really know where i got this recipe from, but i've had it hanging around for a while. these are so yummy, my boyfriend asks for them at least once a week. perfect for a holiday dinner, cookie exchange, or any other party where you want to dazzle your friends/make them love you forever. i sprinkle the top of this with sea salt before i pop it in the oven, i think it adds that little extra something. i've also drizzled it with melted chocolate after they've cooled, but their so rich you really don't need it!</p>

        <ul>
<li>For the shortbread:</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350</li>
<li>Prepare a 9&quot; x 13&quot; pan with either flour and butter , or a piece of parchment paper pressed into the pan and up the sides slightly</li>
<li>Cream your butter and sugar together</li>
<li>Scrape the bowl and add yolks</li>
<li>Scrape the bowl again , making sure the yolks are mixed in , but don't over mix</li>
<li>Add your spices and one cup of flour , mix briefly until just combined , then add your second cup of flour</li>
<li>Your dough should be moist and clumpy , dump this into your pan and press to fit in an even layer , with your finger</li>
<li>This doesn't have to be perfect</li>
<li>Bake for 15-20 min , until just set and lightly browned at edges</li>
<li>Prep your ingredience for the caramel as you put the shortbread in the oven</li>
<li>Put everything except the almonds into a heavy bottomed sauce pan</li>
<li>When you pull the short bread out of the oven , turn the burner on medium , and heat until the mixture is bubbly and starting to brown , stirring fairly constantly</li>
<li>Using a heat resistant spatula is great , so you can scrape along the bottom to prevent burning</li>
<li>This will take 5 min or so from everything melting</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and stir in your almonds until evenly coated</li>
<li>Spread the whole mixture on top of the shortbread and pop it back into the oven for another 15 to 20 minute</li>
<li>The mix will bubble in the oven , its done when the caramel starts to turn golden and the almonds at the edges start to toast</li>
<li>Let this cool for 20-30 min , then cut with a bench knife or a chefs knife</li>
<li>I like to cut them into triangles , but like brownies , you can go for whatever floats your boat on this end !</li>
