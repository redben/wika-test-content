<li>Preheat oven to 375f</li>
<li>In a small bowl combine all the seeds and set aside</li>

<li>Add all but 2 tablespoons of the seeds</li>
<li>Stir the sour milk / buttermilk into the dry ingredients just to blend</li>
<li>Turn out dough on to a well floured board and knead about 5 times , just enough to pull it together into a loose ball</li>
<li>Place the dough on a lightly floured baking sheet and mark it with a deep cross across the top , cutting two-thirds to the way through the loaf with a serrated knife</li>
<li>Brush with a little milk and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of seeds</li>
