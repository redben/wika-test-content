<meta name="description" content="This one was a real winner with my children.  whenever i get out the icing bag, they go bonkers and yesterday was no different.  i had to hold them back when they arrived home from school, so that i could get a couple of these cupcakes frosted the way i wanted for a quick photo shoot.  once i put down the icing bag, my younger son set to work on icing the rest of the batch.  he did a great job and had a good time while my older son ate them.  cupcake fun was had by all.
