<li>Mix together oil , sugars and egg</li>
<li>Add in baking soda , powder , and vanilla</li>
<li>Slowly add flour and mix until consistent</li>
<li>Add oatmeal and chocolate chips</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees f</li>
<li>On a greased or non-stick baking pan , make about 1-1 / 2 inch size drops of dough spaced 2 inches apart</li>
<li>Bake for 10 minutes</li>
<li>In my experience , baking them even a minute longer results in hard cookies once they have cooled</li>
