        <ul>
<li>Trim all the fat and silver skin off the tenderloin , then rub it all over with salt and pepper</li>
<li>Add about half of the butter to a pan and melt it over medium heat</li>
<li>Let it foam , then add the tenderloin and sear it on all sides until it is a nice brown color</li>
<li>Remove the meat from the pan and let it cool</li>
<li>Now in the same skillet , add the rest of the butter and melt over high heat</li>
<li>Add the mushrooms and saut until they reduce in size , but don't let them brown</li>
<li>Just before the mushrooms are done , add the garlic</li>
<li>Pour in the wine and cook over a medium high heat until the liquid is reduced and the mixture is almost dry</li>
<li>Add the thyme , salt and pepper</li>
<li>Remove the mushrooms from the heat and let them cool in a shallow pan</li>
<li>Then put them in a food processor and chop them until they form a rough paste</li>
<li>Set aside</li>
<li>Lay the puff pastry out on the work surface</li>
<li>You may have to use some flour to prevent sticking</li>
<li>Now spread the mushroom mixture in a wide strip down the center of the pastry , leaving about an inch and a half of bare pastry at each end</li>
<li>Slice the pat thinly and lay the slices down the center of the mushroom strip</li>
<li>Brush the tenderloin all over with dijon mustard</li>
<li>As gently as you can , place the tenderloin in the middle of the mushroom and pat strip and wrap the pastry over it</li>
<li>Seal the edges with your fingers , then brush with the egg and water mixture to ensure a good seal</li>
<li>Repeat with the ends</li>
<li>Now turn the wrapped meat over and place it in a greased pan so the seam is at the bottom</li>
<li>Brush the egg mixture over all the pastry , and then make three slits in the top to stop the pastry from bursting open while cooking</li>
<li>Bake at 400 degrees until the internal temperature reaches 120 degrees</li>
<li>So if you want a rare or medium rare beef make sure to take it out early</li>
<li>Use a meat thermometer that can stay in the oven while cooking to ensure perfect results</li>
<li>The pastry should be a golden color when you take it out of the oven</li>
<li>Let it rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing</li>
<li>When you do cut into it , the juices should flow out and you can use this to make an au jus sauce to serve with it</li>
