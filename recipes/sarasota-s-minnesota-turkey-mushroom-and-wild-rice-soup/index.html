            <p>This was a classic growing up. a little creamy, all fresh ingredients, mushrooms from a local farmer, and wild rice from a friend who was from mn, but rented one of our cottages every summer and always brought tons of mn wild rice. now if you don't have turkey leftovers (which i almost always do), use chicken which will work just fine. but there is something about the turkey that is just perfect with this. if i don't have leftover turkey, i often buy a small turkey breast just so i can make this soup, and use the rest for sandwiches. and no turkey stock?  ... chicken stock or broth is fine. just don't skimp on a few things. 1) sherry wine, 2) real wild rice, 3) fresh vegetables and, mushrooms, and; 4) fresh herbs. it just isn't the same otherwise. i can have just a bowl of this for dinner or it makes a great starter, or wonderful with just a salad or grilled sandwich.</p>

        <ul>
<li>Soup base -- in a large pot , melt the butter and add the leeks , onions , celery , fennel and garlic and cook on medium heat until slightly translucent and soft</li>
<li>About 5 minutes</li>
<li>Rice -- add the rice right to the vegetable mixture and stir until well combined - then add the broth , thyme , rosemary , worcestershire and bay leaf</li>
<li>Cover and cook on low heat approximately 30 minutes until the rice is somewhat tender</li>
<li>Once again , taste for seasoning and add more broth if necessary</li>
<li>It depends on how thin or thick you like your soup</li>
<li>The soup still has a bit more time to cook which will allow the rice to finish cooking</li>
<li>Mushrooms -- at this point , add the sherry wine and mushrooms and continue to cook another 15-20 minutes until the rice is tender and the mushrooms are soft</li>
<li>Finish -- everything is done - now to finish off the soup</li>
<li>First , add in the turkey or chicken</li>
<li>And add the heavy cream to the soup</li>
<li>Increase the heat to medium and bring to a light boil and then reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes</li>
<li>Stir and add in any additional seasoning if necessary and the fresh parsley</li>
<li>Serve -- my favorite way to serve this is with a toasted baguette with melted gruyere cheese</li>
<li>Now , if you happen to have truffle oil -- drizzle a little on top , it is heaven</li>
<li>Can't get much better than that ! enjoy !</li>
