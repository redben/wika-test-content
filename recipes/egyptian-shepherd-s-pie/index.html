<meta name="description" content="Every week i cook a dish from a different country just to keep things interesting.  i came across this recipe in my search for an egyptian meal that wasn&#x27;t too exotic for our tastes but would still bring something new and tasty to the table.  well, it was a hit with my family and i figured i&#x27;d put it out there in an easier to access forum for anyone else looking to try something a little different.  if you use 2lbs of fresh sweet potato you can cut down on some of the extra sweetness that comes from using canned sweet potatoes.  i&#x27;ve done it both ways and prefer the fresh myself.  you can make whatever adjustments that suit you.  i hope you enjoy it as much as my family does.">
