        <ul>
<li>&quot;preheat the oven to 375f</li>
<li>Cut each baby eggplant in half , keeping the stem end intact and going straight to the tail</li>
<li>Use one tablespoon of oil to brush liberally over the eggplants , both front and back , before laying them cut side up on a baking sheet</li>
<li>Tuck the oiled eggplant halves in the oven for approximately 20 minutes , or until the flesh is soft and easily pierced with a fork but the bodies have not collapsed</li>
<li>While the eggplant are baking up , its a perfect time to toast the pine nuts</li>
<li>Spread the nuts out on an ungreased baking sheet in a single layer</li>
<li>Tuck them in the oven for 3-5 minutes , shaking the pan halfway through</li>
<li>When the pine nuts are mostly golden brown they are toasted and ready</li>
<li>Shake the nuts off the pan and into a bowl so that they do not continue cooking with the ambient heat</li>
<li>Cooking the bulghar is as easy as can be</li>
<li>Put it into a heatproof container and pour the boiling water over top</li>
<li>Sprinkle liberally with salt and let it stand for 15 minutes</li>
<li>The grain will start to soak up that hot , salty water and rehydrate , becoming tender and fluffy</li>
<li>You could let the bulghar soak for as long as 30 minutes , but i like to drain it after 15 so that it is still a touch al dente</li>
<li>After all , when the bulgar is added to the tomato mixture and baked it will continue to soak up moisture so it shouldnt be mushy soft</li>
<li>The nuts are toasted , the eggplant is baking , and the bulghar is soaking</li>
<li>Life is pretty good</li>
<li>Chop the onions into a small , thin mince and finely mince the garlic</li>
<li>Put the aromatics in a large saucepan , along with the remaining two tablespoons of oil , and set it over medium heat</li>
<li>Starting the onions and garlic off in a cold pan will encourage them to deepen and sweeten without as much risk of burning</li>
<li>After 5-7 minutes when the onions are a pale gold color add the diced tomatoes , honey and dried spices</li>
<li>Okay , so i totally didnt use diced tomatoes here</li>
<li>I used whole canned tomatoes , because i love to squish them into a pulp in my hands before adding them to the pan</li>
<li>We all have our quirky little habits , and that just happens to be one of mine</li>
<li>Give this a stir and turn the heat down slightly to medium low</li>
<li>You will need to cook the tomato mixture for at least 7-10 minutes , stirring fairly regularly , or until the liquid has reduced significantly in the pan</li>
<li>Are the eggplants soft ? as soon as they are cool enough to handle , use a small paring knife to score all around the edges of the eggplant , leaving a skin which is about 1 / 4 thick</li>
<li>Carefully scoop out the flesh which needs to be given a good chop</li>
<li>When the tomato mixture has thickened enough that you can run a spoon through it and still see the bottom of the pan 5 seconds later , add the chopped eggplant flesh and stir it through</li>
<li>Let this cook for a minute or two so that the flavors can combine</li>
<li>Finely chop the mint and parsley leaves</li>
<li>There should be slightly more mint than parsley , but be generous with both</li>
<li>Reserve one tablespoon of the chopped herbs to use as garnish</li>
<li>Take the pan off the heat before adding the bulgar to the tomatoes , along with the pine nuts , mint and parsley</li>
<li>Stir everything together , squeeze in the juice of 1 / 2 lemon , and season quite generously with salt and pepper</li>
<li>You cant afford to be shy with the seasoning in a bulgar dish</li>
<li>Spoon the stuffing into your gutted eggplant halves , pressing it together and really mounding it inches your cupped palm is the best tool that you could have to keep the mixture in a pseudo-dome shape as you press it into the shells</li>
<li>Bake the eggplant for 15-20 minutes , or until they are warmed through and the tops are just starting to brown</li>
<li>Sprinkle the eggplant with your reserved chopped parsley and mint , and serve with a bowl of black olives and some fresh pita bread on the side</li>
<li>The sultry cinnamon and allspice , combined with smoky nutmeg and just a mere whiff of heat from the chili are enough to elevate a simple bulgar and tomato stuffing into the realm of the exotic in a non-intimidating way</li>
<li>Light , clean , healthy and vegetarian dinners are always easier than i expect</li>
<li>In fact , im rather looking forward to putting the chicken breasts aside again a few days from now</li>
<li>&quot;</li>
