<meta name="description" content="This is a lush, delicious chocolate cake filled with fresh cream cheese cream and crunchy pecans and frosted with rich chocolate icing. i came up with this cake for my boyfriends’ birthday and everyone said it was the best they ever tasted. i found the recipe for chocolate icing in a cooking book chocolate sensations. i recommend that you prepare the cake and pecans a day before and finish it in the morning. the cake must cool in the fridge at lest 3 hours but you should leave it on room temperature for an hour before serving. that way the cake is moist and icing creamy.
note: for cream cheese filling i used instant gelatine. you can use gelatine in powder or leaves but you will probably have to adjust the preparation. or you can fill the cake with your favourite cream cheese filling.
the preparation time does not include cooling time.">
