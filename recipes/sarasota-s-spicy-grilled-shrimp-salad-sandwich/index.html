<meta name="description" content="I love this shrimp salad because it is lighter than other versions. sometimes, it seemed all i tasted was mayonnaise which is why i like this version so much. it is creamy with a bit of a kick. serve on croissants with sliced avocado, tomato and creamy cheddar cheese. this can also be served on whole wheat bread, but i prefer the croissants. i like to serve this with a bowl of soup for an easy dinner or lunch. frozen shrimp will work fine for this. but if you can get fresh even better. my grocery store will steam them for me as i shop with a spicy cajun seasoning which is perfect for this. or i bring them home and steam them with some old bay or even in beer.">

            <p>I love this shrimp salad because it is lighter than other versions. sometimes, it seemed all i tasted was mayonnaise which is why i like this version so much. it is creamy with a bit of a kick. serve on croissants with sliced avocado, tomato and creamy cheddar cheese. this can also be served on whole wheat bread, but i prefer the croissants. i like to serve this with a bowl of soup for an easy dinner or lunch. frozen shrimp will work fine for this. but if you can get fresh even better. my grocery store will steam them for me as i shop with a spicy cajun seasoning which is perfect for this. or i bring them home and steam them with some old bay or even in beer.</p>

        <ul>
<li>Shrimp salad -- in a medium size bowl , add the mayonnaise , yogurt (you can use all mayonnaise if you want , but i love the light flavor the yogurt adds</li>
<li>Also , if you like your salad a bit creamier , just add a bit more mayonnaise or yogurt</li>
<li>Stir in the lime juice , chipotle , salt and pepper and add in the cilantro , celery , olives , onion and diced shrimp</li>
<li>Toss well to combine</li>
<li>Sandwiches -- just pile high</li>
<li>Shrimp salad , then avocado , tomato and cheese</li>
<li>Now croissants have plenty of butter in them , so just spray your grill pan or saute pan with a little non stick spray</li>
<li>If using whole wheat bread , i like to butter each side of the bread slices and then grill</li>
<li>If you don't want to grill , this is also just as good served cold with lettuce</li>
<li>When grilling i weigh them down slightly but not too much and grill just until the bread or croissant is golden brown and the cheese is melted</li>
<li>Using a heaving pan is a simple way to weigh them down</li>
<li>One</li>
<li>Just enjoy !</li>
