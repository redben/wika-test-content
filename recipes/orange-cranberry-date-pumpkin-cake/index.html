<meta name="description" content="Try this soft fruity pumpkin cake. when i saw the contest ingredients that could be used in baked goods, orange and pumpkin immediately came to mind to tie them all together. what i came up with is extra special for you to bake and give to family and friends during the holidays. you can easily make this in 12 muffin tins or double it in a bundt pan. for gift giving, mini loaf pans are nice. i’m giving you a choice of 3 delicious toppings: dust with confectioner’s sugar, frost it with neufchatel frosting or ice it with white chocolate icing. or you can make multiple loafs and try all 3! this gets even better after it sits for a couple of days, the spice and orange flavors come out more.">
