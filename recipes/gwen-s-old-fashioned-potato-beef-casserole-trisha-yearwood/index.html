        <ul>
<li>Place the potatoes in a large saucepan with water to cover by 1 inch</li>
<li>Add a generous pinch of salt and cook for 15 minutes , or until tender</li>
<li>Potatoes cook quickly</li>
<li>Test often for tenderness and don't overcook them</li>
<li>Alternatively , cook the potatoes in a pressure cooker for 5 minutes , releasing the pressure immediately to prevent overcooking</li>
<li>Drain the potatoes and arrange them in a 6- by 9- by 2-inch casserole dish</li>
<li>In a large skillet , add a little oil to coat the pan</li>
<li>Combine the beef and onion and cook together over medium heat until the beef is browned and the onion softened , about 10 minutes</li>
<li>Drain excess fat</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees f</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a medium saucepan and whisk in the flour to make a roux</li>
<li>Cook over medium heat , whisking constantly , until the mixture bubbles and the flour turns light brown in color</li>
<li>Gradually whisk in the milk and continue to stir while cooking over medium heat</li>
<li>When the mixture thickens , season with salt and pepper , then stir in the cheese and browned beef and onions</li>
<li>Pour the ground beef mixture over the potatoes and bake the casserole for 20 minutes , until heated through and bubbling</li>
<li>Sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top of the casserole and bake until the crumbs are toasted , about 5 minutes longer</li>
<li>Cook's</li>
<li>Because all the ingredients are fully cooked , if they are still hot when you assemble the casserole , the baking time can be greatly reduced or even eliminated</li>
<li>Simply brown the crumb topping under the broiler for a couple of minutes</li>
</ul>
