<meta name="description" content="This is truly an international take on the classic quesadilla, filled with some of my favorite things! throwing caution to the wind, its a blend of french, asian and carribean ingredients with a nod to the humble yet grand quesadilla. to keep the ingredient list and directions short, i&#x27;ve used store-bought crepes. but crepes are really quick and easy to make - so do yourself a favor and use one of the many great crepe recipes on this site! my personal preference for the cheese is brie (soooo good with the sweet sauce!) but mozzarella is probably really good,too! this recipe was created for raiders of the lost pantry game, 2013. time does not include cooking the chicken filet. as an appetizer, these can be made in advance of your party and pan-toasted at the last minute.">
