        <ul>
<li>Brown ground beef and ground pork in a large saucepan over medium heat , ensure that the meat is well crumbled</li>
<li>When the meat is completely browned cover saucepan and turn heat to low</li>
<li>After ten minutes , remove the ground meat from the heat and drain</li>
<li>While the meat is simmering , in a separate pan , mix the water , wondra and the cornstarch</li>
<li>Whisk thoroughly as it's added until it's dissolved into the water</li>
<li>Add drained meat , all the dry ingredients , vinegar and tomato paste to the water mixture</li>
<li>Place the pan over medium heat and bring to a boil</li>
<li>Stir occasionally , it will burn if you walk away</li>
<li>When chili begins to boil , reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour</li>
<li>Once again stirring occasionally</li>
<li>Chili is now ready to add over a steamed hotdog , soft bun and i use velveeta slices with it</li>
<li>Enjoy !</li>
<li>I have read different reviews on weinerscnitzel chili and those that say there is no meat , should look at their rapper closer , before licking it</li>
<li>There is meat it is just crushed real small</li>
<li>I believe , if followed exactly , this recipe comes extremely close to that delicious sauce found at weinerscnitzel</li>
<li>Please try it and comment back here on your results</li>
