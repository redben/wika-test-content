<meta name="description" content="After the plan for enchiladas was foiled due to not having enough corn tortillas, i threw this together. it could easily be spiced up if you like things spicy by adding jalapenos to the cornbread topping.  i used ground turkey the first time, but any ground meat could be used. i used sour cream because my husband doesn&#x27;t really care for my favorite red enchilada sauce all that much, it helped tame down the &quot;red&quot; flavor. 

**after preparing as written, i would have made the following changes:  add a teaspoon or two of sugar to the cornbread mix, add chopped peppers and onions to meat mixture, and personally i&#x27;d prefer the straight enchilada sauce and some spice to kick it up. overall it was a tasty and quick throw-together meal i plan to make again.**

this recipe was inspired by a recipe called cornburger pie from the cornbread bible: a recipe storybook by jennifer shambrook, phd. i love that book! it&#x27;s available for kindle, too.">
