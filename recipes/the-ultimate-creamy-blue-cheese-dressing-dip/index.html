super simple and full of garlicy goodness  &amp; blue cheese.  great as a salad dressing, raw veggie dip, buffalo chicken wings, etc. i have listed the full 12 ounce jar of marie&#x27;s caesar dressing and 5 oz  container of blue cheese. use as much or as little of each ingredients as you like. the bottom line is, estimate how much you will need &amp; make it to your liking. thin it with mayo &amp; milk if you are looking for a thinner dressing. make it thicker ( dressing &amp; blue cheese only) for dipping. serving size is arbitrary based on the ingredients amounts you decide to use.">

super simple and full of garlicy goodness  & blue cheese.  great as a salad dressing, raw veggie dip, buffalo chicken wings, etc. i have listed the full 12 ounce jar of marie's caesar dressing and 5 oz  container of blue cheese. use as much or as little of each ingredients as you like. the bottom line is, estimate how much you will need & make it to your liking. thin it with mayo & milk if you are looking for a thinner dressing. make it thicker ( dressing & blue cheese only) for dipping. serving size is arbitrary based on the ingredients amounts you decide to use.</p>
        </header>
        <ul>
<li>Decide how much caesar dressing you will need</li>
<li>Add enough blue cheese crumbles to suit your taste</li>
<li>I like lots !</li>
<li>If your dressing is too thick , add milk to thin or mayonnaise to stretch the amount of dressing</li>
<li>Mix , check for seasoning &amp; adding more blue cheese or creamy caesar</li>
<li>Add pepper to taste</li>
<li>Combine all ingredients , but don't smooth out the chunks of blue cheese</li>
<li>That would be criminal !</li>
<li>Serve and enjoy !</li>
</ul>
