        <ul>
<li>If you are using the raw cabbage , turn core side down in dutch oven or soup pot with about 2 inches of water</li>
<li>Cover , and steam on stove until cabbage is pliable</li>
<li>Cool cabbage enough to handle</li>
<li>Cook rice in 2 cups of water only until al dente</li>
<li>Cut each leaf from stem</li>
<li>Remove thick stem part of leaf</li>
<li>At this point decide whether you would like small cabbage rolls or larger ones</li>
<li>Cut each leaf accordingly</li>
<li>Set aside</li>
<li>Chop onion , celery , tomato and mix with rice and vegetarian ground beef , if using , and salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>Pour a small portion of the tomato liquid from the can in to the bottom of the roasting pan</li>
<li>Place one layer of the cabbage leaves over the liquid to prevent any burning or browning of the cabbage rolls</li>
<li>Place about two tablespoons depending on the size of the leaf in to the middle of one of the cooked leaves</li>
<li>Fold one side over , then the ends</li>
<li>Roll up tightly over the fourth side</li>
<li>Place each cabbage roll tightly beside each other in to the pan</li>
<li>When one layer is complete , pour enough tomato mixture over to cover</li>
<li>Repeat if necessary</li>
<li>Cook at 325 degrees f</li>
<li>For about 2 hours depending on how many layers you have , and how deep your dish is</li>
</ul>
