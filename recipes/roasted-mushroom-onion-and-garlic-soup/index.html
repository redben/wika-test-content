            <p>A tasty mushroom soup made with no milk or cream.  white beans are used to thicken, and roasting mushrooms, onions, and garlic in the oven add great flavor.  it's a flexible recipe.  you can use any combination of mushrooms that you'd like, and any kind of broth that you'd like.  this recipe calls for pureeing the onions, garlic and a small amount of the mushrooms, leaving most of the mushroom quarters for the soup, but you can puree as many of the mushrooms as you'd like. i've tried it as written, and also with all of it pureed. i actually like it best all pureed - it's like a more traditional mushroom soup.  adapted from a recipe found online - the original also called for 3 cans of beans, half of which were pureed, and half were left whole for the soup.</p>
